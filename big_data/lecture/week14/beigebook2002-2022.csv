0,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and based on information collected before January 9, 2002. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.       Reports from the Federal Reserve Districts suggest that economic activity generally remained weak from late November through early January. But while there are still indications of caution, there are also scattered reports of improvement. The Dallas and San Francisco Districts report a continued decline in activity, while the Cleveland District indicates that the regional economy appears to be in the process of bottoming out. Economic activity remained slow or weak in the Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, Kansas City and St. Louis Districts. Activity was mixed according to the Atlanta, Minneapolis and Richmond Districts and showed further signs of rebounding in the New York District.    Many Districts indicate that their contacts believe a recovery will begin by mid-year or earlier, but the timing and strength are uncertain. Several Districts say that uncertainty has led some businesses to budget conservatively for the first quarter.    Manufacturing activity was weak or down in most reports, but showed signs of stabilizing or rebounding in several Districts. Retail sales picked up in late December and early January but for the period overall posted generally weak results in most Districts. Auto sales slowed in December--after very strong sales in October and November--but sales remained relatively strong. Construction and real estate activity continued to soften in most Districts. Commercial real estate markets continued to weaken, and while housing markets held up overall, there was further weakness concentrated in the markets for higher-priced homes. Reports on the service sector were mixed but in general suggest sluggish economic activity. Financial institutions reported a slight softening of conditions in late November and December. Drilling activity continued to contract rapidly in response to lower energy prices, and the airline industry continued to suffer from weak demand and soaring security costs.    Labor markets remained soft. There are numerous reports of shrinking wage and benefit packages. The Cleveland District notes that employers are invoking ""economic duress"" clauses to renegotiate union contracts. Most Districts report declining prices for goods and services with the notable exception of sharply rising prices for security, health care, and all types of insurance.   Consumer Spending  Retail sales showed signs of improvement in late December and early January but results were generally weak overall in most Districts. Sales were flat or down compared to last year in the Boston, Richmond and St. Louis Districts. Sales were ""mediocre"" in Atlanta, ""weak"" in Dallas, ""soft"" in Chicago, ""slow"" in St. Louis and ""lackluster"" in San Francisco. Sales were up, however, and better than expected in the Cleveland, Kansas City, New York and Philadelphia Districts.     According to most Districts, there were aggressive promotions and unusually large discounting that reduced profit margins for retailers. The flurry of sales activity in late December and early January left inventories in good shape. Sales were strongest for home furnishings and electronics according to District reports. Sales of menswear were weak, and warm weather discouraged purchases of winter apparel and seasonal sporting goods. Discount stores continued to report stronger sales than apparel or high-end retailers. The Dallas, Boston and Philadelphia Districts note that retailers have reduced purchases for the first half of 2002 in anticipation of weak sales.     Auto sales were slower in December after very strong sales in October and November. Several districts report that sales had remained relatively strong, however, and a few Districts note that December sales were above year-ago levels. The Cleveland, Dallas and Kansas City Districts say their contacts expect first-quarter sales to weaken. The Atlanta, Kansas City and Minneapolis Districts note that inventories of used cars are high due to the large number of trade-ins that occurred in October and November. As a result, used car prices have fallen.   Manufacturing   Manufacturing activity was weak or down in nearly all Districts. Demand is lower for machine tools, metals, textiles, telecommunications and most aircraft equipment. But there are some signs of stabilization or recovery in many reports. For example, the Cleveland District says that the number of manufacturers reporting increases in new orders rose from November to December. In the Atlanta District, several firms noted a modest pickup in new orders and were rehiring some of their recently laid-off staff.     Auto production was mixed but showed indications of picking up. In the Atlanta and Cleveland Districts, some plants worked overtime hours to meet booming demand for their models, while others were forced to close for two weeks because of slumping sales of the models produced at those plants. The Chicago District reports that manufacturers said nationwide light vehicle sales exceeded their expectations again in December despite softening from November. Inventories remained very lean, according to the Chicago District, where one manufacturer indicated that its light vehicle production in the first quarter of 2002 would be 6 percent to 7 percent higher than a year earlier. Demand for some high-tech products has improved since the last survey, according to the Dallas and San Francisco Districts. The Boston and Atlanta Districts report an increase in demand for medical and security-related products, while the Chicago District reports a late-December pickup in steel production.     The reports also suggest more optimism among the country's manufacturers, with many predicting a pickup towards the end of the first half of 2002. A higher percentage of plant managers in the Kansas City District expect increases in production than in earlier surveys. Manufacturers in the Philadelphia District indicate that they have slightly raised capital spending plans for the first half of the year in anticipation of an upturn by the middle of the year. Most contacts in the Cleveland District also expect conditions to improve late in the second quarter or early in the third quarter. Richmond manufacturers anticipate that shipments, new orders and capital expenditures will increase substantially by mid-year. In contrast, most manufacturers of heavy equipment in the Chicago District cut their forecasts for 2002. And, the Boston District reports that capital spending will be tight or reduced significantly according to a majority of their respondents.    Services   Reports on the service sector were mixed but in general suggest weak economic activity. The Cleveland and Dallas Districts report slow demand for temporary workers. Temporary employment agencies in the Richmond District, however, report somewhat stronger demand for most categories of workers.     Transportation and tourism activity was reported to be rebounding in December, but demand remains well below year-ago levels according to the Atlanta, Dallas, Minneapolis, New York, St. Louis and San Francisco Districts. Hotel occupancy rates picked up but are still below a year ago. Business travel remains down, according to the Dallas and San Francisco Districts. But, price cuts stimulated a pickup in leisure travel over the holidays and flights were fuller, according to the Chicago District. The Dallas District notes that the airline industry has significantly reduced capacity over the past two months. With 15 percent fewer aircraft in service compared to a year ago, industry capacity is now at roughly 1997-98 levels. Weak demand has pushed revenues down 15 to 20 percent below last year's levels. Depressed revenues along with soaring security costs have significantly hurt earnings.   Construction and Real Estate   Housing markets continued to hold up in most Districts, although there were pockets of weakness, particularly for higher-priced homes. Commercial markets were softer, with the Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, New York and Richmond Districts reporting higher office vacancy rates. The Atlanta and New York Districts report an abundance of sublease space, while office rents were lower in the Richmond District. The Chicago and Kansas City Districts say that landlords are offering more generous tenant improvement packages that may be masking the full extent of rent declines in the commercial market. In contrast with other reports, the Cleveland District reported ""uncharacteristically strong"" building activity.   Banking and Finance   Financial institutions indicated a slight weakening of conditions in late November and December. Soft or declining loan demand is reported in the Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, New York, Richmond, St. Louis and San Francisco Districts. Competition for quality borrowers remained intense, according to the Cleveland and San Francisco Districts. Demand for commercial loans remained weak. Consumer lending has held up in this recession, but it began to soften at the end of December as higher mortgage rates choked off the surge in refinancing activity. Only the Philadelphia District reports rising loan volumes. The Cleveland and San Francisco Districts indicate some deterioration in asset quality, and the Atlanta and Cleveland Districts note some increase in delinquency rates. Tightening credit standards are reported in the Chicago, New York, Philadelphia and St. Louis Districts.    Agriculture and Natural Resources  The Kansas City, Minneapolis and St Louis Districts note concern about the absence of a protective snow cover for the winter wheat crop. The crop may already have been damaged, according to the Kansas City and St. Louis Districts. Dry weather in the Kansas City District has limited pasture growth, causing most ranchers to be reluctant to expand their cattle herds. Rain and snow helped replenish depleted soil moisture levels and improved the condition of small grain crops in the Richmond District.    Bankers in the Richmond District said low crop prices continue to leave some farmers financially vulnerable. Livestock producers have benefited from lower feed costs and lower prices for nitrogen fertilizer, however. The St. Louis District notes that the price of natural gas--a major cost component in the production of nitrogen-based fertilizer--fell by approximately 75 percent compared with last year. Government payments to crop producers and strong livestock profits in the first half of 2001 will provide some offset for weakness in farm loan portfolios, according to bankers in the Kansas City District.    Drilling activity continued to decline rapidly in response to lower energy prices, according to the Atlanta, Dallas, Kansas City and San Francisco Districts. The U.S. rig count fell from over 1000 working rigs in early November to 887 at year-end. Capital spending in 2002 is expected to be down by more than 20 percent according to the Dallas District.     The San Francisco District reports that interest in siting and building electrical power plants has slowed, with some developers backing off their ""fast track"" approach and taking a more wait-and-see attitude. An iron-ore mine in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and a mine in Northern Minnesota both extended a shutdown, according to the Minneapolis District, while another mine in Northern Minnesota ended an eight-week shutdown but is operating at reduced production levels. Several Kansas City District firms report expansion of coal-bed methane exploration activity.     Labor Markets   Labor markets remain soft, according to most District reports. Further layoffs are expected in the Boston District, but the Chicago and New York Districts say labor markets are stabilizing.    While there were reports of shrinking pay increases in the Chicago District, some firms are freezing pay scales in the Boston District, and downward wage pressures are reported in the Cleveland, Kansas City and San Francisco Districts. These Districts report the elimination of hiring bonuses, decreases in moving allowances and reduced merit increases. Employees are also being asked to pay a larger share of health care and other benefit costs than in past years and to accept more limited health plan options. The Cleveland District says union contracts were being renegotiated due to adverse economic conditions. Employers in the steel and aerospace industries have invoked ""economic duress"" clauses that exempt them from certain job-security provisions. Some of these renegotiations have involved wage concessions or agreements to postpone (with ""give-back"" provisions) scheduled wage increases.    Prices   Districts report declining prices for most goods and services with the notable exception of security, health care and medical, property and liability insurance. The Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Minneapolis and New York Districts report steep increases in insurance costs.     Energy costs are lower and, as the Cleveland District notes, firms have reduced or eliminated energy surcharges. According to the Dallas District, warm weather and flagging demand led to declines in natural gas, crude oil and refined product prices. Forecasts of colder weather and collaboration between OPEC and non-OPEC producers to restrict crude oil production led prices to bounce back to just below mid-November levels. Inventories of most energy products, however, are significantly higher than a year ago.",2002-01-16
1,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and based on information collected before February 26, 2002.  This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of the Federal Reserve officials.       A majority of Federal Reserve districts report some signs of improvement in economic conditions in January and early February.  The Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San Francisco districts note some pickup in activity, Chicago cites a more positive tone, and Kansas City and St. Louis say that economic activity is weak, but there are some bright spots.  Cleveland indicates that although some positive signs continue to emerge, overall business conditions in the district have neither improved nor deteriorated compared with the end of last year.  New York reports mixed signals, and Dallas notes continued weak activity.        Most districts say that manufacturing activity is generally weak, but selected industries in some areas are showing more positive results.  Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas, Richmond, Kansas City, and San Francisco report modest improvements in retail sales recently compared with the end of last year.  Retail results were more mixed in the other districts.  Districts indicate that residential real estate markets are generally stronger than commercial markets.  Reports on demand for bank loans are mixed across the districts.  Warm, dry weather figures prominently in agricultural reports.  Warm weather and the slow global economy have contributed to weaker energy demand.       Labor markets continue to be slack in most districts, with many citing business contacts who have suspended bonuses, frozen wages, or skipped annual salary increases.  However, contacts at temporary employment firms in several districts suggest employment is bottoming out, and new hires in selected occupations are said to be in short supply.  While wage and price pressures are described as ""subdued"" to ""largely nonexistent,"" business contacts in many districts mentioned rising health insurance costs.  Firms in most districts indicate that their purchase and selling prices are generally stable, but Dallas reports upward pressure on services prices and declining prices for chemicals and paper, while Cleveland notes an increase in spot market prices for steel.     Retail  Most districts report that retail sales during January and February were unchanged from a year earlier, but several noted improvement in early 2002 compared with late 2001.  In addition, the Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Kansas City districts say that sales were higher in early 2002 than a year earlier.  New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco indicate that while tourism continues to be weak, it has improved since the second half of 2001.  Home furnishings and appliances were reported to be growing strongly in the Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City districts.  Philadelphia, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco note that motor vehicle sales remain solid, but are down from the rapid pace set in the fourth quarter of 2001 because price promotions have ended; Dallas also reports that automobile dealer profit margins are lower.      Wage and price pressures in the retail sector are virtually nonexistent.  Retail employment is said to be stable in Boston, but down in the Richmond and San Francisco districts.  Most districts indicate that retail contacts expect flat to slightly increasing sales during the first half of 2002; only retailers in the St. Louis and Philadelphia districts expect somewhat stronger sales growth during this period.  The Boston, Cleveland, and Kansas City districts say that retailers expect sales growth to resume at a modest pace during the second half of 2002.     Manufacturing   Manufacturing activity is reported to be generally weak but showing signs of improvement in at least some industries.  The most positive reports come from Philadelphia and Richmond, indicating ""moderate"" or ""solid"" growth in manufacturing shipments and orders during January and February.  Many districts report that recent manufacturing activity has been ""mixed.""  By contrast, Kansas City says manufacturing production ""fell further below year-ago levels,"" while Dallas says it ""remained weak.""  Among districts commenting on expectations for this year, all signal that either a majority or a growing fraction of manufacturers expect higher production by the second half of the year.      Cleveland and Chicago report a pickup in automotive production in response to higher demand; decreases in other districts were said to be due partly to winter storm conditions.  Boston, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco note stabilization or slight improvement in demand for high-tech products, which their contacts attributed largely to lean finished goods inventories in these sectors.  St. Louis and Dallas indicate that petrochemical and oil refinery production has been sluggish.  Reports on most other industries are mixed, with increased production in some parts of the country and decreased production in others.      Throughout the nation, manufacturers are said to be experiencing flat or declining costs for materials and energy.  Selling prices are reported to be mostly flat, but several districts mention modest increases in steel prices from low levels.      Some districts comment that manufacturers are no longer cutting back on labor to the same degree they did in 2001.  For example, Cleveland mentions that manufacturing employment has fallen but that widespread layoffs in steel and aerospace appear to have subsided.  Manufacturers in the Philadelphia and Richmond districts also are said to be reducing regular employment but holding steady or increasing the length of the workweek.     Nonfinancial Services  Although services industries were mostly sluggish or flat in recent months, selected industries reported improvements.  Boston notes rising demand for software products and related services.  In the Cleveland district, for the first time in more than a year, significant numbers of contacts in the trucking and shipping industry noted improvement.  Dallas reports that law firms and accounting firms note strengthening demand for work on litigation, bankruptcy, auditing, and taxes.  Demand for communication services improved in the San Francisco district.      Conditions in the temporary labor market continue to be slack in most reporting districts, but the worst seems to be over.  District reports suggest that widespread layoffs have subsided and demand for workers appears to be stabilizing.  The Richmond district is the most upbeat, with reports of strengthening demand for temporary workers in recent weeks.  Atlanta notes improvement in outplacement activity, even though labor market conditions remain weak.  Other districts indicate that ample supplies of labor are still readily available, although certain areas of employment in some districts bucked the sluggish trend.  The legal industry in New York exhibited strong demand for temps; employers in the Richmond district are seeking light industry workers and customer service representatives; and, in Dallas, demand was strong for administrative and clerical positions, and in the banking and retail industries and some professional services.      Banking and Finance  Loan demand is generally mixed in the reporting districts.  Dallas, Kansas City, New York, and San Francisco report falling overall demand while Atlanta, Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Richmond report mixed results.  Overall lending activity is picking up in St. Louis and Chicago.  Demand for consumer loans is down or continues to be soft in the Cleveland, New York, and Philadelphia districts, but Atlanta is experiencing growth in demand.  Commercial and industrial loan demand is similarly mixed, with Philadelphia and St. Louis reporting increasing demand, Cleveland and Kansas City showing lower demand, and the Chicago, Dallas, New York, and Richmond districts all indicating stable or mixed demand.  Mortgage and refinancing loan volumes are steady to strong in the Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and Richmond districts, with only New York and Philadelphia reporting slowing demand.  New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco all report stricter loan requirements, while the requirements in Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City, and Richmond are reportedly unchanged.  Delinquency rates are stable in Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, and New York.  Cleveland and Philadelphia report some decline in loan applicant quality.  Richmond reports that stock market investors are ""in a holding pattern,"" and Atlanta's contacts note that there is little new money entering the venture capital industry.        Real Estate and Construction  Real estate markets are mixed, with commercial markets almost universally said to be weak while the residential segment remains strong.  Increased office vacancy rates are reported in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco districts.  The rise in available commercial space has been exacerbated by active sublease markets and additional construction in some areas.  Office rents have declined moderately compared with a year earlier.  Consequently, commercial construction activity has slowed in most reporting districts.      Residential markets remained steady or strengthened during the last two months.  Home sales and demand for houses are reported to be strong in the New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco districts.  Lower-priced home sales are especially strong, while demand for the high-end segment of the market has weakened in a few districts.  New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Minneapolis note increased home sale prices compared with a year earlier.  New home construction was unchanged or increased in Cleveland, St. Louis, and Minneapolis, but was lower than a year ago in Kansas City.     Agriculture and Other Natural Resources  The unusually warm, dry weather in much of the country dominates news from the agricultural sector.  The dry spell has resulted in poor conditions for the winter wheat crop or has reduced winter pasturage in the Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas districts.  As a result, Dallas district ranchers are reducing their herds.  But in San Francisco, where farmers have already cut their inventories of cattle and field crops, they now report improved prices.  Despite producer concerns about the farm economy, Kansas City district bankers indicate that farmers' balance sheets remain strong, thanks to steady land values and government support.  St. Louis contacts also report a slight rise in land values.  Looking ahead, Dallas notes that preparation for the corn and cotton crop is on schedule, and that, despite a cotton surplus and low prices, farmers are planning to plant as normal.  In the St. Louis district, farmers expect to plant less wheat and cotton than last year; however, they are waiting for passage of the federal farm bill before finalizing their plans.           According to the Atlanta and Dallas districts, the second warmest U.S. weather on record for November through January plus global economic weakness have damped demand for heating oil and natural gas and have kept prices low.  Minneapolis reports that drilling activity has fallen slightly in recent weeks, while Kansas City notes that the district's count of active oil and gas drilling rigs remains near the two-year low hit in late 2001.  In the Dallas district, energy activity shows signs of bottoming out and stocks of crude oil, heating oil, and natural gas are all well above last year's levels.  Because firms storing natural gas will not want to hold it over the summer, many Dallas contacts expect significant downward pressure on natural gas prices this spring.  In the case of mining, Minneapolis iron ore production is up slightly from late 2001 levels and is nearing more normal levels.  In Kansas City, higher coal prices have encouraged increased activity.",2002-03-06
2,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and based on information collected before April 16, 2002.  This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials       Almost all Federal Reserve Districts reported signs of improvement or actual increases in economic activity since the last survey.  The sole exception was Boston, which described economic activity as mixed.  While the overall tone was positive, a few districts expressed qualifications about the pace of the recovery or the strength of their regional economies.  Cleveland said its economy continued to improve but cited concerns that the rate of improvement had slowed considerably from earlier in the year.  Also, Kansas City and Dallas noted that their economies were still weak despite recent signs of improvement.     Retail sales increased or held steady in most districts, and all districts reported stable or improved manufacturing conditions.  Manufacturers' capital spending plans, however, remained limited.  Residential real estate activity was strong in most districts, as both home sales and construction increased.  Tourism activity also improved in most areas, while other services activity held steady.  Demand for bank loans was little changed in most districts, although increases were reported in some regions.  Commercial real estate markets remained generally weak, especially in the San Francisco, Dallas, and Atlanta districts, but showed signs of steadying in the New York, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City districts.  Energy activity continued to ease, and agricultural crops in several districts were damaged by adverse spring weather.   Despite the increases in economic activity reported in many districts, labor markets remained slack and wage and price pressures generally stayed in check.  Demand for labor showed signs of firming in several districts but was still reported as weak in others.  Except for skilled health care workers, there were very few reports of labor shortages.  Also, those districts that mentioned wage pressures described them as minimal.  Retail prices were generally flat.  Steel producers sharply boosted prices, but most other manufacturers held prices steady despite reports in some districts of higher costs for fuel, steel, and petroleum-based inputs.     Consumer Spending  Most districts reported that retail sales held steady or rose moderately in March and early April.  Philadelphia and Richmond reported increased sales from previous months, and Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City reported sales above year-ago levels.  Sales appeared to be weakest in the Dallas district, although retailers there reported some signs of improvement as well.  In the New York, Chicago, and St. Louis districts, sales at discount retailers were reported to be better than at general merchandise stores.  Home furnishing items continued to sell particularly well in most districts.  Apparel sales were reported as weak in some districts, but as rebounding somewhat in the New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland districts.  Store managers across the country appeared to be largely satisfied with inventory levels, and were generally positive about the outlook.  Retailers in the Kansas City district, however, said they were ready to begin discounting if sales did not meet expectations.  Automobile sales were characterized as mixed or flat in most districts reporting on such activity.  Dealers were cautiously optimistic about future sales in the Philadelphia and Kansas City districts.  On the other hand, Cleveland district auto dealers did not expect to meet last year's sales levels, and dealers in the Dallas district were concerned that rising interest rates would dampen sales.  Dealers in the St. Louis district were also keeping inventories a little lower than usual in case sales did not pick up.   Manufacturing  Manufacturing activity in March and early April was reported to be either stabilizing or showing signs of improvement in all districts.  Plants in the Philadelphia and Richmond districts reported continued growth in orders and shipments, and many plants in the St. Louis district were hiring new and previously laid-off workers.  Boston and Kansas City also reported signs of a looming turnaround, but noted that activity was still weak compared with a year ago.  Industries reporting the strongest activity included producers of auto parts, steel, residential building materials, and furniture.  Activity also remained solid at automobile plants in the Cleveland and Chicago districts and among semiconductor producers in the Boston, Dallas, and San Francisco districts.  Textile and apparel manufacturers in the Richmond, St. Louis, and Dallas districts experienced increases in demand as well, but the rebound follows numerous plant closures.  Plants in most districts reported a stabilization of inventories following a lengthy period of decline, and some firms in the Chicago and San Francisco districts were cautiously increasing stock levels.      Manufacturers were generally optimistic about the outlook for factory activity later in the year.  Purchasing managers in the New York district, in fact, reported their highest expectations for increases since mid-2000.  In contrast, some producers of capital goods in the Boston district expected weakness to continue until 2003.  Despite the generally positive outlook, capital spending plans remained rather limited across the country.  Kansas City reported a similar number of firms expected to increase as to decrease capital expenditures over the next six months.  Philadelphia reported that manufacturers have raised capital spending plans, on balance, but that the planned increases have been spotty and concentrated mainly in the chemicals and plastics industries.   Real Estate and Construction  Residential real estate activity remained robust.  Housing markets were reported to be strong in most districts, with both home sales and new construction showing continued gains.  The housing market in the Boston district was described as very strong, with listings in short supply throughout the region.  In New York, further strengthening in home sales has caused the number of unsold homes to dwindle and has led to some acceleration in housing prices.  Richmond also reported especially strong housing activity, with one metro area described as the best sellers' market ever and another metro area said to be experiencing rapidly escalating home prices.  There were, however, a few exceptions to the overall strength in housing activity.  Home sales softened somewhat in the Chicago district, and residential construction activity remained weak in the Dallas district.  Moreover, demand in several districts was weaker for high-end homes than for low- and mid-priced homes, and demand for rental units in the New York district was not as strong as that for houses.    Commercial real estate activity remained generally weak but appeared to be stabilizing in a few districts.  Markets remained especially weak in the San Francisco, Dallas, and Atlanta districts.  In the San Francisco district, vacancy rates continued to increase, lease rates continued to decline, and new construction was at a minimum.  In the Dallas district, office markets were still being held back by overcapacity and weak demand, causing steep declines in rental rates in many areas.  Commercial markets in Atlanta also continued to suffer from weak demand, limiting new construction.  Commercial builders in the Cleveland district expected to be busy in the coming months but were somewhat less optimistic than in the previous survey, with more projects still in the planning stage than they had hoped.   On the positive side, commercial markets in a few districts showed some signs of stabilization or improvement.  Leasing activity strengthened in the Richmond district, and office vacancy rates appeared to level off in the New York, Chicago, and Kansas City districts following months of steady increases.  There were also scattered reports in the Chicago district of sublease space being pulled off the market by tenants who had overestimated the extent of the business slowdown.   Tourism and Services  Travel and tourism continued to improve, yet remained below year-ago levels in most reporting areas.  Richmond and Minnesota reported strong ski seasons in their districts, and Atlanta reported that theme parks in Florida were busy and cruise lines were operating near capacity.  New York and Richmond both reported that hotel business had improved.  Expectations for the summer travel season were high in most districts.  However, Atlanta reported that some contacts fear high fuel costs may limit automobile travel this summer and Kansas City reported that advance bookings at mountain resorts were still trailing year-ago levels.     Activity in other service industries was generally steady.  Trucking service firms in the Cleveland district noted a moderate increase in the volume of manufacturing shipments, while Dallas indicated that demand for transportation services was still low relative to past levels.  In the Cleveland district, trucking firms' operating margins remained very thin due to high fuel and insurance costs.  A media company in the Richmond district reported that ad revenues rose for the first time in over a year, and insurance firms in Boston reported continued high demand for life insurance.  Demand for legal services, particularly in the areas of litigation and bankruptcy, increased somewhat in the Dallas district.   Financial Services  Demand for bank loans held steady or rose modestly in most districts.  Banks in the Cleveland, San Francisco and Atlanta districts reported some increase in demand for consumer loans and home-purchase mortgages, while banks in the New York district experienced increased demand for nonresidential mortgages.  Demand for business loans was up modestly in the Philadelphia district but flat in other districts.  In the Chicago district, banks noted that recent improvements in business sentiment were not translating into increased loan demand.  Similarly, banks in the Philadelphia district said their business customers were seeing increased demand but were showing little inclination to take out loans to finance the expansion of facilities.  In contrast to home-purchase mortgage lending, mortgage refinancing activity in most districts was down from the high levels reached last year.      Changes in credit quality showed no clear pattern.  At banks in the New York district, delinquencies fell for consumer loans and residential mortgages.  At banks in the Atlanta district, consumer delinquencies increased but remained manageable.  Banks in the Chicago district reported that business loan quality had stabilized following previous deterioration but was still fragile.  Banks in the Philadelphia and Kansas City districts were still limiting their commercial real estate lending, and banks in the New York district continued to tighten standards for all types of loans except residential mortgages.  Otherwise, lending standards were unchanged in those districts reporting on them.   Natural Resources and Agriculture  Activity in the energy sector continued to ease.  Despite recent increases in oil and natural gas prices, contacts in the Dallas and Kansas City districts reported that exploration and production activity in the oil and gas sector was contracting while Minneapolis reported flat activity.  Kansas City indicated that the higher prices have produced some optimism about future activity.  Some producers in the Dallas district also expressed interest in increased future activity, but others were merely taking advantage of increased prices to improve their balance sheets.  Outside of the oil and gas industry, Minneapolis reported that activity in the iron ore sector was expanding with the reopening of some shuttered extraction and processing facilities.     In the farm economy, spring weather conditions have adversely affected some areas.  Continued low levels of soil moisture in most of the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas districts have damaged crops, while portions of the Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis districts reported excessively wet conditions.  Recent cold weather may have also damaged the apple, peach, and strawberry crops in the Richmond district.  The winter wheat crop was reported to be doing well in areas with sufficient moisture, including the Cleveland and St. Louis districts, but has been severely damaged in the drought areas of the Minneapolis and Kansas City districts.   Spring planting is either under way or is expected to begin soon in most districts, with St. Louis and Chicago reporting that more acres are being devoted to corn and fewer to soybeans this year.   Labor Markets, Wages, and Prices  Labor markets remained generally slack.  Modest increases in demand for workers in some industries were reported in the New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, and St. Louis districts, but otherwise demand was weak across the nation.  San Francisco and Dallas reported that employers still have the advantage in most hiring situations, and firms in the Kansas City district enjoyed a rising number of job applicants and declining turnover rates.  The only workers reported as being in short supply in more than one district were those in skilled health care occupations.   Wage pressures, when mentioned, were characterized as minimal.  Half of the manufacturers contacted in the Boston district expected to hold wages steady at least until the second half of the year.  San Francisco reported that wages were being held back due to significant increases in health care and other insurance premiums.  New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Dallas also reported substantial increases in insurance costs.     Price pressures for consumer goods were generally subdued, and prices for most manufactured goods held steady despite higher costs for steel, fuel, and insurance.  Retail prices were essentially flat in the New York, Kansas City, and San Francisco districts and were flat to down slightly in the Boston district.  Retail price pressures in the Chicago district also remained subdued, with price-conscious consumers discouraging retailers from going ahead with planned increases.  Steel producers in the Cleveland and Chicago districts raised prices significantly.  Despite reports of increasing input costs in some districts, other manufacturers generally held their selling prices constant.   Concerns about rising input costs were especially pronounced in the Dallas district, where rising costs for fuel, petroleum-based products, and insurance were said to be adversely affecting many industries.",2002-04-24
3,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and based on information collected before June 3, 2002.  This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.     Reports from Federal Reserve Districts indicated that overall economic activity expanded at a moderate pace in late April and May.  The tone was one of modest but uneven growth, with some major sectors showing signs of improvement while others softened or remained weak.  Retail sales were flat in most Districts, and auto sales were mixed.  Activity in the services and manufacturing sectors improved overall but varied across regions and segments.  Residential real estate markets generally remained robust while weakness persisted in most commercial markets.  Districts noted few changes in lending markets.   Labor markets remained slack in most Districts, but several Districts reported higher demand for temporary workers.  Price pressures were in check for most goods and services, but many Districts noted rising steel prices and continued increases in energy and insurance costs.   Consumer Spending Most Districts reported that retail sales were similar to year-ago levels.  Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Minneapolis reported that recent sales were flat on a year-over-year basis.  According to New York, Chicago, and Dallas, sales were sluggish.  Sales in the Boston, Philadelphia, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts were improved, in contrast.  Cleveland reported mixed results.  Unseasonable weather reportedly hampered sales in the New York, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas Districts.  Most Districts continued to report balanced inventories.  Reports on automobile sales in late April and May were uneven.  Sales were robust in the Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts.  Reports from Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas were mixed.  Philadelphia and Kansas City said that sales were down on a year-over-year basis, although Philadelphia noted that sales were at healthy levels.  In the Atlanta and St. Louis Districts, some dealers complained about lost sales because potential buyers did not qualify for credit.    Services and Tourism  The services sector posted modest growth.  Business was up for financial, legal, information technology, and trucking firms in the Philadelphia District.  Cleveland reported a significant increase in demand for trucking and shipping services, and the demand for legal services was strong in the New York and Dallas Districts.  New York, Richmond, and Atlanta said that computer-related service firms were experiencing weak demand; San Francisco noted heavy discounting of software and high-tech services.  Boston, in contrast, reported some growth in demand for software products and services, particularly for health care-related software.  Reports on the tourism and hospitality industry generally continued to indicate an upward trend.  Hotel occupancy picked up slightly in the San Francisco District and remained steady in the New York District.  Richmond and Boston said that hotels reported steady demand and were hiring additional staff; sources in South Carolina said that business had ""turned the corner"" from September 11 effects.  Atlanta and San Francisco reported strong forward bookings for summer tourist destinations, and Florida theme parks were adding to payrolls. Chicago noted that a major airline was experiencing strong leisure travel but weak business travel.  In the Cleveland District, business conference attendance remained lower than last year.   Construction and Real Estate Residential real estate activity remained robust in most Districts.  Home sales improved in the New York, Atlanta, and St. Louis Districts compared with the previous year, and Richmond said that sales were up overall compared with the last Beige Book.  Existing home sales picked up in the Chicago District, but new home sales were not as strong.  San Francisco reported solid activity in most areas, while Kansas City noted strong sales of lower-priced homes and weak sales of high-end homes.  Philadelphia reported high sales levels and accelerating prices.  Richmond also noted rising home prices.  Dallas, in contrast, said that builders reported a drop in sales and were offering concessions.  Single-family construction varied across Districts, with activity up in the St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts and remaining solid in most of the Kansas City District.  Kansas City and Minneapolis noted slowing or weakness in the multifamily market, but the Manhattan multifamily market strengthened, according to New York.  Most Districts continued to report weak commercial real estate markets, with high vacancy rates and lower rental rates.  Boston, Atlanta, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco characterized commercial markets as weak.  Commercial markets eased in the Philadelphia District and declined in the Cleveland, Kansas City, and Minneapolis Districts.  New York reported that markets were stabilizing in the New York City area.  Chicago reported mixed results.  Richmond noted an increase in commercial activity, mainly in the office segment.   Manufacturing Factory production, shipments, and orders were higher in most Districts, but the gains were uneven across industries.  Automakers in the Cleveland District reported strong activity, and Chicago noted a surge in heavy truck orders as customers sought to make purchases ahead of EPA regulatory changes, scheduled to take effect October 1.  Richmond indicated strong growth in shipments and orders for textile products, and St. Louis reported increased demand for a variety of non-durable goods.  In the Philadelphia District, producers of construction materials continued to report robust demand.  Dallas commented that refineries were operating near capacity for most of April and May.  According to San Francisco, contacts indicated a pickup in new orders and sales in the semiconductor industry, which allowed producers to draw down inventories.  More generally, inventories of finished goods were flat or lower in most Districts, although Kansas City noted that some plant managers were increasing inventories.  Boston and San Francisco said that orders were down considerably for suppliers of aircraft components.  According to Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco, demand for telecommunications equipment remained weak.    Banking and Finance  Demand for bank loans was little changed, with conditions generally better on the consumer side than on the commercial side.  Cleveland, Atlanta, and Dallas reported robust consumer lending.  Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas said that business lending was soft or sluggish.  Chicago said that firms were wary of borrowing to make large capital outlays.  New York, in contrast, reported sagging loan demand on the consumer side but rising demand from commercial borrowers.  Improvements in bank earnings, loan quality and demand were noted at San Francisco District banks.  New York and St. Louis reported tighter or stable credit standards, while Philadelphia and Atlanta noted that some lenders have become more cautious in business lending.  According to Cleveland and Atlanta, reports on loan delinquencies ranged from no change to a slight increase.  Contacts in New York and Chicago reported that delinquency rates were lower or stable, while St. Louis noted a rise in defaults.  Philadelphia reported that the outstanding loan volume has been moving up somewhat in recent weeks.   Labor Markets and Prices  Labor market conditions improved marginally but remained slack overall.  As a consequence, reports cited little upward pressure on wages.  Labor market conditions were little changed in the Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts.  Richmond and Dallas said that labor market conditions were mixed, whereas New York reported some improvement.  Minneapolis noted that general labor market conditions eased slightly.  Temporary employment agencies experienced increased demand in the Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, and Atlanta Districts.  Dallas noted that demand for temps rose in the manufacturing sector but declined in several service industries.  Temporary worker demand was flat in the Cleveland District. Kansas City and Minneapolis noted an ongoing shortage of nurses, and skilled tradesmen were in short supply in the Kansas City District.  Price increases remained subdued overall, but the prices of a few goods and services rose substantially.  Most Districts reported steel prices were sharply higher.  Dallas said that the prospect of further steel price increases had spurred strong sales for fabricated metal products.  Rising insurance costs were noted as concerns in the Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts.  Boston, Richmond, and Dallas reported higher prices for energy and petrochemical products.  New York and Dallas reported that manufacturers generally were not able to pass along higher input costs.   Agriculture and Natural Resources Many Districts noted poor agricultural conditions.  Richmond, Kansas City, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco reported that a drought was hurting crops and cattle in at least part of their Districts; some crops in the Richmond District were stunted by a late frost.  Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City also noted problems resulting from unseasonable weather conditions.  Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported concerns about low livestock prices, while cattle ranchers in Texas expect to face higher costs because all livestock leaving the state may have to be vaccinated against bovine tuberculosis.  Energy-related activities were up in the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts.  Kansas City attributed some of the rebound to anticipated increases in natural gas prices in coming months.  Minneapolis noted expansions in the iron ore mining industry.",2002-06-12
4,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and based on information collected before July 23, 2002.  This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.       District reports suggest that the economy expanded modestly in recent weeks, with an uneven performance across sectors. Boston, New York, Atlanta, and Dallas noted some tapering off in economic growth, while Cleveland and St. Louis indicated some improvement.  Reports from the rest of the Districts point to continued moderate growth. Overall, prices of finished goods and services remained stable, though there were scattered reports of price pressures.    Retail sales were mixed, with four Districts indicating some weakening, but five reporting a pickup, partly weather-related.  Retail inventories were said to be in good shape, and many retailers expressed optimism about the near-term sales outlook.  Vehicle sales were seen as weak in June but were boosted by incentive programs in early July.  Manufacturing activity, though mixed across Districts and industries, appears to have improved, on balance.    Residential real estate and construction activity was widely described as strong, though some softness was reported in the rental segment.  In contrast, commercial real estate was almost universally described as weak, though stable in some cases. Travel and tourism activity was reported to be little changed overall, with the Western Districts tending to fare somewhat better than those on the East Coast.  Reports from other service industries mostly pointed to stable activity.  Banks reported strong demand for residential mortgages, steady demand for consumer loans, and weak, but in some cases improving, demand for commercial loans.  Credit quality was still described as good, with no significant increases reported in delinquency rates.  Agricultural conditions were described as poor in a number of Districts.      Labor markets were characterized as slack but relatively stable in most Districts; New York and Kansas City indicated some softening, but Richmond noted modest improvement. The pace of wage increases generally remained subdued, but many Districts noted continued escalation of non-wage benefit costs, most notably health insurance.  Prices of raw materials were generally stable, though prices of steel, plastics, and lumber have risen noticeably.   Prices of finished goods and services were generally flat.   Consumer Spending    Retail sales were mixed across the Districts, with auto sales getting some boost from incentive programs in July.  Some pickup in non-auto sales was reported in the New York, Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis and San Francisco Districts, with some of the strength attributed to weather.  However, Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas indicated some weakening in spending.  In general, purchases for the home--building materials, hardware, and furnishings--were characterized as strong.  None of the Districts reported any complaints about retail inventory levels, although New York and San Francisco mentioned some intended inventory accumulation in anticipation of a longshoremen's strike on the West Coast.      Looking ahead, there tended to be a general sense of optimism about the near-term outlook, though contacts in a number of Districts expressed concern about the risk that declining equity markets would affect the real economy.  Retailers were said to be optimistic about the sales outlook in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and Kansas City.  However, contacts in the Boston and Dallas Districts expressed some concern.  New York reported a decline in consumer confidence in June.      Reports from automobile dealers were mixed, with June sales described as somewhat disappointing but July sales boosted by incentive programs.  Cleveland noted a decline in new car sales, but steady demand for used vehicles.  Looking ahead, auto dealers expressed some concern about inventory levels and future sales prospects in the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts.     Manufacturing    Manufacturing activity was generally reported to have improved modestly. While none of the Districts reported a general decline, many noted that some industries were expanding moderately while others were continuing to struggle. Vehicle assemblies and parts production were reported as expanding by Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, Boston, and Atlanta, although Philadelphia reported some slippage in transportation equipment orders. The semiconductor industry has continued to improve according to Dallas, San Francisco, and Boston.     Production of construction-related materials, primarily residential, was still displaying strength in the Chicago District, generally up according to Dallas, brisk as reported by Philadelphia, and relatively strong in the Atlanta District. New York reported a general increase in overall manufacturing activity through June, but a modest weakening of conditions in early July. Minneapolis reported activity as increasing in Minnesota and the Dakotas. Richmond reported mixed conditions, with a rise in tobacco and paper manufacturing, but slippage in furniture and textiles. Kansas City saw continuing signs of a manufacturing recovery, despite some weakening in the volume of new orders, and firms were not quite as upbeat as a few months ago. Inventories were generally reported as steady or continuing to decline, and nearly all Districts reported continued optimism about the near term.   Real Estate and Construction    Residential real estate continued to show strength in virtually all Districts, but the commercial real estate sector continued to struggle.  An overwhelming majority of Districts described the housing market as robust, with sturdy gains in sales activity and varying degrees of price appreciation.  The weakest report on this sector came from Dallas where housing markets were said to be unchanged.  Despite the overall strength, some weakness was noted at the upper end of the market in Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco.  Declining equity markets were cited as one cause of this relative weakness, though New York noted that there has been no discernible effect thus far.  In contrast, a number of Districts indicated that declining stock prices have actually boosted the perceived attractiveness of real estate as an investment.  Apartment rental markets were reported to have softened in Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco, but to have stabilized in New York.      Residential construction activity was mixed but generally strong.  Strong or increasing activity was reported in Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco.  Shortages of developable land were said to be inhibiting construction activity and driving up prices in the Boston and Chicago Districts.      Commercial real estate markets remained weak in most areas, with increasingly slack conditions noted in New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco.  However, Cleveland noted an up-tick in conditions, though from low levels.  Despite widespread weakness in office markets, Richmond noted some scattered signs of strength in the market for retail and warehouse space.  Commercial construction activity continued to be sluggish in most areas.   Tourism and Services    Tourism and travel activity was relatively stable, on balance.  Signs of improvement were noted across much of the western United States--specifically in the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts.  However, there were reports of modest weakening in Districts along the Atlantic Coast.  New York noted some slippage in hotel room rates; Richmond reported strong tourism activity and increased air travel in July but weaker hotel bookings for the months ahead; and Atlanta indicated declining hotel occupancy rates, as well as shorter stays and less spending by visitors to Florida.      Conditions in other segments of the service sector were mixed.  Boston reported that insurers have seen strong demand for life insurance but some declines in health plan membership due to softening labor markets.  Richmond reports strong growth in trucking and shipping activity.  Dallas notes slow improvement in service sector activity.    Banking and Finance     Banks report little change in overall lending activity, with continued strong demand for home mortgages and continued weak demand for business loans.  Some softening in consumer loan demand was reported in New York and Dallas, but a moderate increase was noted in Atlanta.  Home mortgage lending was reported to be strong in most Districts, with further strengthening seen in Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City.  Also, refinancing activity increased in the Chicago and Kansas City Districts but weakened in New York and Cleveland.  Delinquency rates were mostly stable and overall credit quality was described as strong and stable in most areas--including St. Louis, which reported an increase in bankruptcy and past-due filings.  Tighter lending standards were reported in New York and Kansas City.    More broadly, San Francisco reports that the financial sector remains healthy, but Philadelphia reports that investment firm revenues have been adversely affected by consumers shifting funds from equities to money markets.    Agriculture, Mining, Natural Resources    Agriculture conditions were mostly reported as poor, although conditions improved in parts of the South and West. Much-needed rains improved conditions in the Dallas District, parts of the Minneapolis District, and in Florida. However, drought or near drought conditions persisted in the Chicago, Richmond, Cleveland, and Kansas City Districts, and some states in the St. Louis, Minneapolis and Atlanta Districts. Most soybean and corn-producing areas suffered from oppressive dry conditions. A particularly severe drought continued to pummel Virginia and the Carolinas. Areas with dry weather also reported deteriorated pasture conditions for livestock grazing.    Energy activity was described as strong by Kansas City and Dallas, though oil and gas drillings leveled off in both Districts in late June and early July after a strong May. Dallas reported smaller energy firms pulling back in recent weeks, cautious about anticipated lower demand for oil and natural gas. Kansas City reported some downward pressure on earnings in the natural gas industry, with prices flat nationwide but falling sharply in Wyoming.   Labor Markets, Wages, Prices    Labor markets were generally reported as subdued, with little or no upward pressure on wages. There were spotty reports of increased hiring in particular occupations, such as engineers, skilled nurses, skilled construction workers, and mortgage processors.  While most Districts indicated little change in labor markets, New York and Kansas City reported some softening since the last Beige Book, and most contacts in the Cleveland and Minneapolis Districts indicated that they had no plans to increase hiring.      Temporary employment activity was mixed but a bit stronger on balance--while New York and Chicago reported weakness, Richmond, Dallas, Atlanta, and Cleveland indicated some increase in activity.  In the manufacturing sector, Richmond and Chicago reported some recent weakening in employment; however, Kansas City noted some improvement, and contacts in New York and Richmond indicated some pickup in labor demand in light manufacturing.  Richmond and St. Louis commented that manufacturers plan to increase employment in the months ahead.  Separately, Richmond reported increased hiring at service and retail firms, but Boston indicated a decline in retail administrative and sales workers.  Job declines continued in the airline industry in the Dallas District.     Wages were reported to be steady.  Dallas noted some decline in wages of temp workers, while Kansas City indicated scattered labor shortages, but otherwise there was virtually no mention of wage pressures.  However, there were widespread reports of escalating non-wage benefit costs.     Prices for most goods and services were steady, with the widely noted exceptions of insurance (particularly health insurance), building materials (particularly lumber), steel, plastics and paper.  Prices of other inputs, as well as selling prices, remained flat or declined, especially in manufacturing, according to nearly all Districts. There was continued discounting of retail products to entice consumers, according to some Districts. Spikes in wholesale spot electricity prices were reported in the San Francisco District due to warm weather. Boston reported a firming of semiconductor prices but declining prices for other high-tech goods. Dallas noted a continued downward drift of natural gas prices due to a build-up of inventories, which are likely to reach record levels by late summer. Chicago reported a firming of land prices for residential construction, while Richmond reported a moderate rise in service sector and manufactured goods prices.",2002-07-31
5,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and based on information collected before September 3, 2002.  This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of the Federal Reserve officials.       District reports suggest that the growth of economic activity has slowed in recent weeks, with a good deal of variation across sectors.  Although Atlanta and San Francisco reported modest improvement, most Districts indicated slow and uneven economic growth, with mixed or scattered experiences across sectors of the economy.  Boston and Dallas reported little change in the overall level of economic activity.    Retail sales were generally mixed, although seven Districts reported strong sales of home furnishings or appliances.  Three Districts attributed slow apparel sales to unseasonably warm weather.  Back-to-school supplies were reported to have sold well in three Districts, although another District reported disappointing sales.  All Districts noted that retail inventories were at desired levels, with some reporting that inventories are being kept leaner than in the past.  Almost all Districts reported an increase in auto sales over 2001 levels, mostly due to aggressive financing and rebate incentives.    On the whole, manufacturing activity was sluggish, with a good deal of variation by industry and region.  In particular, some Districts reported weakness in the high-tech and building materials industries, although other Districts reported strength in the auto and steel industries.  The strength of the tourism sector varied across the Districts, with six indicating an increase in business and four reporting low or mixed activity.  Almost all Districts noted that business travel has remained at a low level.    Most Districts reported little or no gain in employment in July and August, although three noted that the demand for temporary workers has strengthened.  In most Districts, the prices of inputs and final goods increased slightly or remained flat.  Despite few signs of pressures on wages, there was widespread concern about the effect that rising health care costs might have on labor costs.      Nearly all Districts reported strong residential sales and construction activity.  On the other hand, commercial real estate markets remained weak.  Banks in all Districts report strong demand for residential mortgages and refinancing, although business lending continued to be weak across the board.  Credit quality was described as good and delinquency rates as either stable or declining.    Drought conditions have been adversely affecting crops and livestock through most of the West and large areas along the East Coast.  The experience elsewhere was more mixed, with yields severely reduced in some areas and near-record levels in others.  Oil prices have risen while natural gas prices have been largely unchanged.  Natural gas inventories are expected to be at record high levels when the heating season begins.   Consumer Spending    The retail sales picture was mixed for the nation as a whole in July and August, with some Districts posting declines in sales and others noting slight gains over 2001 levels.  Home furnishings and other home products were strong sellers in Kansas City, Atlanta, St. Louis, Cleveland, and New York.  Some Districts noted robust sales of back-to-school items while others have been disappointed with sales so far.  San Francisco and Boston reported strong demand for large appliances.  Several Districts, including Cleveland, New York, and Philadelphia, noted that warm weather was responsible for sluggish sales of fall apparel; others reported that apparel sold well.  All Districts noted that retail inventories are in line with expectations, although a few heard that retailers are maintaining leaner inventories than in the past.  Chicago, Dallas, and Boston reported that discount stores have continued to register stronger sales than general merchandisers.  While Minneapolis noted that mall traffic was strong in August, other Districts reported a drop-off.  Overall, retailers are cautiously optimistic about the fall, expecting sales to be flat or slightly up from their 2001 levels.    Almost all Districts reported an increase in auto sales over 2001 levels, mostly due to the aggressive financing and rebate incentives offered.  Inventories are at desired levels for most contacts, although many dealers are clearing out 2002 models to make room for 2003 models.  Most Districts report that dealers are optimistic about sales for the next few months.   Manufacturing and Other Business Activity    Reports of manufacturing activity indicate that there was little to no growth in July and August, although Atlanta and St. Louis reported modest improvement.  Some industries have struggled with sluggish orders while others have experienced moderate gains.  Although several Districts noted that overall orders in the high-tech industry are still weak, demand for semiconductors has continued to improve in Dallas and San Francisco.  Boston and Cleveland reported that residential appliance activity was up.  While Philadelphia reported strong demand for construction materials, Dallas, Minneapolis, and Atlanta have seen declines in demand for these products.  According to contacts in the Chicago, St. Louis, and Cleveland Districts, activity in the steel industry continued to increase.  These Districts, along with Atlanta, also saw higher production of automobiles and automobile components.  Richmond and Atlanta saw increases in orders and shipments of packing materials.  New York reported a mild rebound in manufacturing activity in August after a dip in July, while the Kansas City manufacturing sector saw fewer signs of improvement in July and August.  Several reports noted that positive attitudes still prevail, but manufacturers have become less optimistic than they were earlier in 2002.    Reports from the tourism sector were also mixed across Districts.  St. Louis, Minneapolis, Atlanta, Kansas City, Chicago, and New York reported an increase in business, while Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Richmond observed low or mixed overall activity.  Most Districts noted that the duration of leisure visits has declined and that visitors are spending less money per trip.  Almost all Districts noted that the level of business travel is low, as is demand for air travel, which has been affecting hotel occupancy rates in some areas.  Dallas reported that auditing activity was strong, as was the demand for some legal services.  The Atlanta District noted that Mississippi gaming activity has been strong.  Boston reported that the temporary employment industry and the majority of software and information technology services have seen flat-to-modest increases in sales and revenue this summer.  Trucking firms in Maryland and North Carolina reported soft demand.   Labor Markets and Prices    Labor markets in several Districts -- Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Minneapolis -- showed little change since the last Beige Book.  In New York, hiring remained sluggish, although some signs of a pickup were noted for August.  Firms in Kansas City expressed little interest in new hiring as they wait for further signs of improvement in the economy.  Many contacts in Chicago indicated a downward trend in the demand for workers in the retail sector while retail payrolls in Boston and Richmond held steady.  Manufacturers in Richmond and St. Louis reported little new hiring, although one manufacturing contact in Chicago reported a modest increase between June and July.  The majority of manufacturers in Boston expect only small changes in employment for the rest of 2002.  The Boston and Richmond markets for temporary employment experienced stronger demand in recent weeks.  In Dallas, call centers and light industrial and manufacturing firms have the most need for temporary labor.  Overall, wages were reported to be flat, with virtually no reports of upward pressure on wages.  Contacts in San Francisco, however, reported an abundant supply of labor and flat-to-slightly elevated wages.     Prices, too, remained unchanged, on average, although Atlanta, Dallas, Kansas City, and Boston reported an increase in steel prices.  Prices of inputs and final goods increased slightly or remained flat in most Districts.  The prices of building materials were said to be up in Atlanta, although San Francisco and Kansas City reported that these prices remained low in July and August.  In almost all Districts there was concern about the rising cost of health insurance, which is leading some businesses to have higher labor costs.    Real Estate and Construction    Despite the weakness in commercial markets, most Districts, except for Dallas and Philadelphia, reported strong residential sales and construction activity.  Contacts in Richmond and Cleveland attributed this vigorous activity to a favorable interest rate environment.  In the Atlanta District, strong sales in some Florida markets have created a shortage of homes.  July saw the highest number of monthly home closings for the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in five years.  Existing home sales for July and August picked up in some Chicago markets.  Prices for single-family homes in New York and Minneapolis were up in the second quarter from a year earlier, but apartment rents were reported to be lower than a year ago.  Philadelphia and Dallas are the only Districts reporting less than robust residential sales.  Real estate agents in Philadelphia reported an easing in the rate of sales in both new and existing homes for July and August.  Total home sales remained unchanged in Dallas.  Homes priced below $150,000 in Dallas continue to sell, but sales for higher-priced homes are slow.  In Kansas City, sales and starts were also stronger for entry-level homes than for higher-priced homes.    Commercial real estate markets remained soft in Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco.  Boston, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Kansas City noted increased office vacancy rates for portions of their Districts while San Francisco reported unchanged vacancy rates for commercial and industrial space.  New York, Richmond, Atlanta, and St. Louis indicated little or no overall change in commercial markets.  Commercial construction opportunities slowed in Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco.  Commercial realtors and contractors in Kansas City and Boston do not see any signs of improvement in the near future.     Banking and Finance    Bank loan demand was generally mixed.  However, Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago reported a moderate rise and New York, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported an uneven experience.  Demand for mortgages and refinancing remained high across the nation, with Richmond noting a marked increase.  Contacts in Philadelphia expressed concern about the sustainability of real estate lending in the absence of growth in other sectors.  Business lending continued to be weak in all of the reporting Districts.  Demand for consumer loans has been strong in Chicago and Atlanta but mixed in New York and Philadelphia.      Delinquency rates were reported to be either stable or declining.  However, credit standards have been tightened for commercial and industrial loans.  St. Louis noted that such tightening has only occurred for small firms.  Credit standards for other loans remained largely unchanged, except in Atlanta, which reported a tightening.  Cleveland and Chicago reported no change in the quality of consumer or business loans; Philadelphia, however, noted a mild slippage.    Atlanta noted a surge in the number of borrowers looking to shorten the term of their loans.  Cleveland reported increased competition across all lines of lending while San Francisco noted an increase only for low-risk lending.   Agriculture and Natural Resources     Drought conditions across much of the West and portions of the eastern United States have adversely affected both crops and livestock.  Although recent rains have improved crop conditions in some areas, hot and dry weather during the middle of the year reduced the corn, soybean, and hay crops in parts of the Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and Kansas City Districts.  As a result, bankers in the Kansas City District expect crop insurance payments to be a significant source of producers' income this year.  Chicago noted that moisture conditions were notably less favorable for crops in Illinois and Indiana than elsewhere in the District, with contacts in central Illinois observing potential corn yields one-third lower than a year ago.  In contrast, other portions of the Chicago District expect near-record corn and soybean yields; in addition, San Francisco reported that sales of fruits, vegetables, and nuts were high, spurred in part by strengthened export demand.  Prospects for the cotton crop are good in Dallas and St. Louis, and the wheat harvest in Montana is expected to exceed significantly 2001's drought-ravaged crop.     Livestock producers in the Kansas City, Richmond, and Dallas Districts have been providing supplemental feed to livestock due to dry weather and poor pasture conditions.  Richmond also indicated instances of hauling water to livestock.  Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco reported that livestock farmers were paring herds, with liquidation under way in some areas of the Dallas District.    Oil producers in the Dallas and Kansas City Districts reported increased oil prices, while natural gas prices, on average, were largely unchanged.  Natural gas inventories declined slightly in the Dallas District but are expected to be at record high levels when the heating season begins.  Reports from Dallas, Kansas City, and Minneapolis indicate that the count of active oil and gas drilling rigs remained unchanged in July and August.  The Dallas District also noted that foreign drilling activity was down slightly but that revenues were up due to the complexity of the projects.",2002-09-11
6,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and based on information collected before October 15, 2002. This document summarized comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.       Most Districts reported that economic activity remained sluggish in September and early October. Retail sales were weak across the nation, including some declines in motor vehicle sales from very high levels. Most Districts noted that manufacturing activity had declined or grown more slowly. Home building and residential markets were generally upbeat. Commercial real estate markets softened. The agricultural sector was mixed; many areas were hurt by drought, but other regions reported ideal growing conditions and bountiful harvests. The energy sector had slowed, and mining activity was uneven. Labor markets were lackluster in all Districts. Overall wage and price increases were moderate, but significant price increases were noted in health care, insurance, and shipping. Most Districts reported strong consumer loan demand and weak commercial lending activity. Credit quality deterioration was reported in some Districts.   Consumer Spending  All Districts noted weak retail sales in September and early October, while tourism activity was mixed. In the Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia Districts, retail sales declined during September. Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported that sales growth had slowed. In the New York District, retail sales were below plan. Clothing retailers noted slow sales in St. Louis. Retail establishments gave varied reports in the Richmond District, while sales were near low year-ago levels in the Atlanta District. Boston reported a modest pickup in sales in September after experiencing flat to declining sales during the previous two months.     Motor vehicle sales generally slowed from very high levels. September and early October auto sales decreased in the Atlanta, Dallas, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia Districts. Cleveland, St. Louis, and San Francisco reported that sales grew more slowly. However, vehicle sales were mixed in the Richmond District and were slightly higher than a year ago in the Kansas City District, although auto dealers there expressed uncertainty about future sales.     Tourism activity was mixed. Fall tourism was solid in several parts of the Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts but was uneven in the Chicago and Richmond Districts. Meanwhile, most reports from the Atlanta District's hospitality and tourism sector were more downbeat than previously indicated, and travel demand was sluggish in most areas of the San Francisco District.   Manufacturing  Manufacturing activity decreased or grew more slowly in September and early October for most of the Districts. ""Tough,"" ""stagnant,"" or ""sluggish"" describe manufacturing conditions in many Districts. Richmond reported that shipments, new orders, capacity utilization, and employment all declined. Dallas indicated weakened activity in all manufacturing industries. Chicago noted weak demand for heavy equipment. However, the St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts reported slight increases in manufacturing activity. Many Districts reported reluctance of manufacturers to undertake capital spending.   Real Estate and Construction  Home building and residential real estate activity was positive, although softening was noted in some regions and in the higher end of the market. Chicago and Minneapolis reported overall strong home building activity. Residential real estate markets in the Boston, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts were strong overall, but contacts noted slowdowns in some areas. While growth in home sales slowed somewhat in the Richmond District, residential real estate remained upbeat. Little changed for home builders in the Cleveland District. Residential real estate markets in New York showed signs of softening, particularly at the upper end of the market. The demand for higher-priced homes was weak in the Atlanta District, and activity in the single-family market tapered off in the Dallas District.    Commercial real estate and construction activity softened in several Districts. Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and San Francisco reported weak conditions in commercial real estate markets. Commercial realtors reported generally flat leasing activity in the Richmond District. While office vacancy rates rose in Dallas, public projects remained a source of strength. In New York, commercial real estate markets were mixed. The demand for commercial real estate was very high in St. Louis; however, construction was slow.    Agriculture  The agriculture sector showed mixed results during September and early October. Dallas and San Francisco reported favorable conditions. San Francisco noted that yields and sales of fruits, vegetables, and nuts were high. Meanwhile, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Minneapolis reported varied conditions. Atlanta reported that Florida citrus and sugar production benefited from adequate rainfall and warm temperatures, but excess moisture hurt soybean production in Louisiana and Mississippi. Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City reported deteriorated conditions primarily due to drought.     Natural Resource Industries  Energy exploration activity declined, while mining activity varied. Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas reported weak drilling activity for oil and natural gas, but contacts in Kansas City and Dallas anticipate some pickup in the near term.  Meanwhile, Minneapolis indicated mixed results in mining.   Labor Markets  Labor markets were lackluster, with only a few reports of increased hiring. Employment demand softened somewhat in Chicago and Minneapolis. In New York the overall market was sluggish, while Atlanta and Boston noted mostly flat employment levels. Labor markets were slack in Kansas City; however, Richmond and Philadelphia reported increases in demand for temporary employment. St. Louis reported fewer layoffs by manufacturers, but some noted that they planned to hold off on new hiring.    Wages and Prices  Increases in wages were generally subdued. Wage pressures remained virtually nonexistent in the Kansas City District. Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco reported little upward pressure. In Dallas, contacts in the temporary services industry noted downward pressure on wages. Wages increased 3 percent to 4 percent in the Boston District.    Overall prices were reported as stable, with significant increases noted in health care, insurance and shipping. Vendor and selling prices remained steady in Boston. San Francisco and Minneapolis reported little upward pressure on prices. Boston and Atlanta indicated decreases in lumber prices. Retailers in the Chicago and New York Districts noted little pressure on prices. Some Districts, however, reported price increases. Health care costs continued to escalate in the Atlanta District. Significant insurance cost increases were noted by Dallas and Minneapolis. San Francisco and Minneapolis reported increased shipping prices, due in part to the work stoppage at West Coast ports.   Financial Services  Most Districts noted that consumer lending demand, especially residential, was strong, while commercial lending demand was weak. Some Districts indicated slight credit quality deterioration. Most Districts reported very strong demand for home refinancing. Meanwhile, Boston reported that life insurance companies continued to see strong demand. However, most Districts indicated low commercial loan demand. For example, Richmond reported that businesses reduced borrowing due to an uncertain economic environment. Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, and San Francisco reported a slight deterioration in credit quality in some sectors. Philadelphia noted recent deterioration in credit quality of consumer loans, and San Francisco indicated increasing delinquencies and loan defaults in some markets.",2002-10-23
7,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia based on information collected before November 18, 2002.  This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a representation of the views of Federal Reserve officials.       Economic activity grew slowly, on balance, in late October and early November, according to information received by Federal Reserve District Banks.  Business conditions were described as soft or sluggish in Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas.  Cleveland and St. Louis reported mixed conditions.  There was marginal improvement in Philadelphia, Kansas City, and New York.  Richmond and San Francisco reported continued growth, but at a slower pace than in the previous survey period.    Consumer spending varied among Federal Reserve Districts.  There was some improvement in general merchandise sales in New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas.  Sales were weak in Chicago, Minneapolis, St. Louis, and San Francisco.  Auto sales have fallen in all Districts.  Service industry activity was generally sluggish.  Manufacturing remained soft in most Districts, but Philadelphia and Minneapolis noted some improvement.  Business capital spending in all sectors continued to be limited.  Commercial real estate markets continued to be slack in all the Districts reporting on this sector.  Residential real estate remained strong, although New York, Chicago, and Dallas saw some signs of easing demand for housing.  Agricultural conditions have been adversely affected by heavy rain and cold weather in southern parts of the nation but are good elsewhere.  There has been little change in energy production but mining has declined.  Bank lending remains strong for residential real estate, but other categories of lending have been lackluster.      Labor markets continued to be soft in nearly all Federal Reserve Districts, although demand for health-care workers remained strong.  Wage and salary pressures were subdued, but employee health-care costs continued to rise sharply.  Most Reserve Banks reported nearly steady prices at both the consumer and producer levels, with the exception of shipping charges, which have risen in the wake of the West Coast port disruptions.         Consumer Spending  Retail sales of general merchandise varied among Federal Reserve Districts in October and early November.  Gains were reported in New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas.  However, the increases were generally slight compared with late summer and early fall.  Atlanta described retail sales as mixed and about even with a year ago.  Chicago and Minneapolis reported weak retail sales, and St. Louis and San Francisco indicated that retail sales had declined from September to early November.  The onset of colder weather in most parts of the country boosted sales of outerwear.  Sales also increased for food and grocery items and small home furnishings, but several Districts noted flat or declining sales of big-ticket and luxury items.  Discount stores posted better sales growth than other types of stores in most Districts, and in New York and Philadelphia retailers reported that consumers were shifting purchases to discount brands.    All the Districts reporting on auto sales noted declines in October compared with the same month last year and compared with the sales rate set during most of the year until October.  The slower sales rate continued in November, and some further declines were noted in the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts.  Dealer inventories have increased.  In the Philadelphia and St. Louis Districts, dealers said inventories were too high, but dealers in the Chicago and San Francisco Districts said inventories were not excessive despite the increase.    Tourism activity has been mixed.  Boston, Richmond, Minneapolis, and Kansas City reported that recent tourist travel, lodging, and spending had increased from last year in most parts of their Districts.  Chicago indicated flat tourism.  In the Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, travel and tourism have been weaker this year than last, although Atlanta noted that advance bookings for winter cruises were strong.   Services  Service industry activity remained weak.  In Boston, demand for information technology services has declined.  Service companies in the Richmond District have had sluggish revenue growth.  Service-sector activity was slow in the Dallas District, and demand for most business services was said to be soft in the San Francisco District.    Trucking firms in the St. Louis District still have large backlogs resulting from the West Coast port disruptions.  Delays in receiving shipments were reported from Boston and Philadelphia, although deliveries in those Districts appeared to be getting back to normal.  Atlanta-area retailers remain concerned about getting all their holiday merchandise delivered before Christmas.  Also in the Atlanta District, Asian motor vehicles and parts have been in short supply because of the West Coast shipping interruption and slowdown. Dallas reported that transportation activity in the District was at low levels.  In Cleveland and Kansas City, there were few reports of difficulties obtaining shipments.   Manufacturing  Most Districts reported continuing weak conditions in the manufacturing sector in October and early November. Demand for manufactured goods remained soft in the Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas Districts.  Conditions were mixed in the Cleveland, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts, although San Francisco noted an increase in cancellations of orders at manufacturers in the District.  Kansas City reported an apparent stabilization in the District's manufacturing sector in late October and early November after a decline earlier in the fall.  Manufacturers in the New York, Philadelphia, and Minneapolis Districts reported some improvement, on balance.    Conditions varied among specific goods-producing sectors.  Boston and Chicago indicated that capital goods industries had flat or falling sales.  Producers of industrial equipment were seeing improved demand in the Philadelphia and Richmond Districts.  Philadelphia and Dallas noted declining orders for construction materials.  Orders at defense plants have increased according to Boston and Atlanta.  New York noted a fairly broad rebound in the manufacturing sector.  In general, manufacturers have been producing below capacity, and they have been implementing cost-reduction measures to maintain profitability.    Among the Districts reporting on manufacturing inventories, there was no clear pattern.  Manufacturers in the Philadelphia and Cleveland Districts have reduced inventories recently.  Inventories remained low among manufacturers in the San Francisco District.  Chicago District manufacturers had recent increases in inventories but generally described inventory levels as ""fair.""   Capital Spending  Business capital spending continues to be limited, according to most of the Reserve Banks reporting on this activity.  In the Boston District, retailers generally plan little if any increases for 2003, manufacturers' plans are mixed, and information technology and software companies will keep their capital budgets flat.  In the Richmond District, retailers' plans are mixed, although most are planning upgrades to information systems next year.  Manufacturers in the Philadelphia District plan to increase capital spending in the next six months, on balance, and there are some reports of higher capital spending among manufacturers in the St. Louis District.  But manufacturers intend little change in capital spending in the Kansas City District in the next six months, and they are delaying or canceling spending in the Atlanta District.   Real Estate and Construction  Commercial real estate markets remained weak in all twelve Federal Reserve Districts.  Rising vacancies, increased subleasing, and declining rents have been evident in nearly all office markets.  Commercial construction has also slackened.  San Francisco reported that commercial development has all but stopped.  Commercial construction has picked up in a few parts of the Richmond and St. Louis Districts, even though those Districts also reported general softness in nonresidential construction.    Residential real estate markets continued to be strong in the majority of Districts.  There has been little change in the pace of home sales in Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City.  In the Cleveland District home builders have been exceeding planned construction rates, and home building in the Minneapolis District is ahead of last year's pace.  Residential real estate markets remained ""solid"" in San Francisco, but growth of new home construction has slowed.  Both San Francisco and Atlanta reported some weakening in demand for homes in the higher price ranges.  Three Districts indicated that residential markets were softening: New York, Chicago, and Dallas.  In the Chicago and Dallas Districts cancellations of house-construction contracts have increased.   Agriculture  Recent rains in many parts of the nation have ameliorated drought conditions, but heavy rains in the South have damaged some crops and delayed field operations.  This year's grain crops, especially corn and soybeans, in the Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts are expected to be below those of recent years.  The cotton crop in the St. Louis District and the sugar cane crop in the Atlanta District were also significantly damaged by rainstorms.   In contrast, farmers in the Minneapolis District expect large increases in corn, soybean, and wheat production, and Dallas expects good cotton and winter wheat crops.   Natural Resource Industries  Federal Reserve Districts reporting on the energy sector noted little change in activity in October and November.  In the Minneapolis District, oil and gas production rose slightly, but exploration efforts have been flat.  The oil and gas rig count edged up in the Kansas City District but was steady in the Dallas District.  According to contacts in the Kansas City District natural gas inventories were high, but unusually strong winter demand could outstrip production capacity.  Minneapolis reported that non-energy mining activity in the District had moved down somewhat.   Financial Services and Credit  Residential loan demand continued to be strong in most Districts for both refinancings and purchase mortgages. New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas noted continuing strength or further growth in mortgage activity.  However, Atlanta and San Francisco reported recent slowing in mortgage activity.  Commercial and industrial loan demand remained soft in New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis.  Such loan demand was said to be flat in Cleveland and edging up in Kansas City.  Bankers in the Philadelphia, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts said business loan demand was low because businesses have less interest in or need for funds, since their inventories, accounts receivable, and investment spending have declined.  Reports of weakening consumer loan demand, other than real estate related, came from New York, Philadelphia, and Dallas.  Consumer loan demand has strengthened somewhat in Cleveland, Chicago, and Kansas City, although growth rates were not robust.    Cleveland, Dallas, and San Francisco reported that deposits have been growing at banks and other depository institutions in their Districts, but Kansas City indicated that deposits in that District have been flat.  Philadelphia noted that sales of annuities have been growing in that District as investors look to increase their returns but are reluctant to make further commitments in the stock market.    Employment and Wages  Nearly all Reserve Banks reported continued softness in labor markets, although New York indicated there were scattered signs of a pickup in demand.  Kansas City reported a continuing high rate of lay-off announcements.  Hiring at temporary employment agencies was picking up, although slowly, in Boston, but growth in temporary help employment had stalled in Chicago and was described as ""lukewarm"" in Richmond.  An exception to the generally flat demand for workers in most Districts is the health-care sector, where the supply of available workers remains below employers' needs.  Retailers will hire close to the normal number of seasonal employees, according to Philadelphia and Richmond, but stores in Atlanta are being cautious in adding workers for the holidays.    Wage and salary pressures remain subdued.  Kansas City indicated that wage pressures were virtually nonexistent.  Dallas noted that temporary help wages have been flat or declining.  San Francisco reported that many firms in that District were canceling usual year-end bonuses.  Although wage and salary trends have been weak, increases in employee health-care costs have been large and widespread.   Prices  Most Reserve Banks reported generally steady retail prices in November.  Boston indicated that retail prices for goods have been flat and that hotels, restaurants, and tour companies have introduced low-priced package deals.  New York noted a decline in selling prices for most consumer goods.  Chicago and San Francisco said retail prices have shown little change.      In the industrial sector prices have changed little.  Manufacturers' selling prices have been flat to down, and prices for software and information technology services have been practically unchanged in Boston.  Manufacturers' selling prices have declined in New York, although input costs have risen.  Manufacturers' input costs and output prices have been mainly unchanged in Philadelphia.  Manufacturers in the Chicago District said they have little pricing power.    Minneapolis reported modest price increases generally, and Dallas noted more price reductions than increases.  San Francisco noted that truckers, marine shipping companies, and air freight companies have imposed extra charges related to shipping delays occasioned by the West Coast port problems.",2002-11-27
8,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco based on information collected before January 7, 2003.  This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve System and is not a representation of the views of Federal Reserve officials.       Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated subdued growth in economic activity from mid-November through early January, with little change in overall conditions relative to the last survey period.  Most Districts characterized growth as ""sluggish"" or economic activity as ""soft"" or ""subdued.""  The weakest report came from Dallas, where economic activity ""remained anemic.""  As in the last survey, conditions in the New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland Districts were more favorable overall than in other Districts, with each, especially New York, describing various signs of improvement.    Reports on consumer spending were consistently weak, with disappointing holiday sales that, in nominal terms, mostly were at or below last year's levels.  Automobile sales surged at year-end in response to favorable sales incentives.  Manufacturers expanded production a bit on balance, with notable gains for defense-related and biomedical products.  Providers of nonfinancial services saw little change in existing weak demand, and business travel remained slow, although there were some reports of improved performance in the tourism sector. Home sales and residential construction activity remained at high levels but slowed a bit in some areas, and the widespread overhang of commercial real estate persisted.  Agricultural production was hampered by adverse weather in some areas and performance was mixed.  Extraction activity in the energy sector responded very little to sharp increases in energy prices.  Bank lending continued to expand in most Districts due to strength in consumer and real estate borrowing.  Labor demand was mostly flat, and despite rising costs for employee benefits and some inputs, increases in employee compensation and final prices were held down by competitive supply conditions.   Consumer Spending  Most Districts reported disappointing retail sales revenues during the survey period, with holiday season spending that was flat or down a bit compared with spending in the previous year. In Cleveland, sales were ""very poor,"" with most respondents reporting declines of 1 percent to 10 percent from year-earlier levels; San Francisco reported ""lackluster"" sales that were ""well below [retailers'] expectations.""  Most other Districts saw flat sales, although Richmond and Minneapolis noted scattered reports of solid sales growth, largely due to strength in post-Christmas purchases.  A relatively short holiday season and inclement weather in some areas played small roles in holding sales down.    In most areas, sales were stronger at large discount chains than at traditional, higher-priced department and specialty stores.  Consistent with these observations, substantial discounting on holiday retail sales items was reported in all Districts, with Chicago explicitly noting deeper discounting compared with a year earlier.  New York and Philadelphia reported moderate accumulation in retail inventories, but other Districts reported generally balanced inventories, due to a combination of conservative planning and the dominant role of low prices rather than low sales volume in determining weak nominal sales revenues.    Among product lines, the strongest holiday sales were recorded for consumer electronics and toys.  Automobile sales showed signs of weakening in some areas, but according to Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago, favorable year-end financing and price incentives produced a sales flurry in late December, lifting overall sales to high levels for the survey period.   Manufacturing  The manufacturing sector continued to struggle with weak demand and excess capacity, although, on balance, slight improvement was evident.  The strongest report came from New York, where manufacturers statewide reported increases in new orders, shipments, and hours worked and were ""overwhelmingly optimistic"" about the near-term outlook.  Overall activity was flat to up slightly in most other Districts.  However, Kansas City reported weakened activity in December after signs of stabilization earlier, and St. Louis reported widespread announcements of employment cuts among manufacturers of durable and nondurable products.     Demand for high-tech products was flat or improved a bit in Dallas and San Francisco, with the latter reporting increased sales of semiconductors for use in wireless technologies.  Boston, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco cited sales gains for pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, and defense-related equipment.  Manufacturing activity increased slightly in the Minneapolis District, with expanding capacity and production levels reported in the heavy machinery, metals, and electronics sectors.  Automobile manufacturers in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts faced mostly stable demand, with a sales surge at the end of the year helping to bring inventories down from November's excessive levels.  Declines in construction-related manufacturing were reported in Chicago and Dallas, and Richmond reported weak demand conditions for apparel manufacturers.   Most Districts reported little or no increase in capital spending by manufacturers.  Atlanta noted declining demand for capital goods, and Kansas City indicated that capital spending fell in December after having firmed in October and November.  Looking ahead, Philadelphia reported that the number of firms intending to boost capital spending in the first half of 2003 fell recently, and capital spending among manufacturers in the San Francisco District is being held down by excess capacity that is expected to persist for six months or more at the current pace of expansion.   Nonfinancial Services  Demand for business and professional services was somewhat weak and, overall, exhibited little change from the previous survey period.  Philadelphia and Richmond described overall demand for services as ""flat"" or ""steady.""  Dallas noted slow demand for accounting and legal services, and in the San Francisco District demand for advertising and related media services was soft.  Boston reported good sales and revenues for insurance companies but noted that poor investment results kept hiring and capital spending frozen.  Demand for trucking services remained strong in the Cleveland District despite a slowdown in December that was larger than the usual seasonal lull, and St. Louis reported steady demand for trucking but uneven profits due to rising fuel costs.  Relative to seasonal norms, hiring or planned hiring of temporary service workers was slow in Philadelphia, Richmond, and Dallas.  By contrast, New York reported ""brisk,"" broad-based hiring of temps in December.    Performance indicators in the travel and tourism sector were mixed.  New York reported higher hotel occupancy and room rates compared with a year earlier.  In the Atlanta District, hotel bookings in tourist areas have climbed back near their levels from the year 2000, although convention business in Atlanta has been hampered by persistent weakness in business travel.   Atlanta and Richmond indicated that travelers are delaying travel plans to an unusual degree, and New York noted that recent figures on advance ticket sales for Broadway theaters were running 15 percent below a year earlier.  Because of favorable weather conditions, early season ski receipts were excellent in the Richmond, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts.  However, Richmond reported weakened tourism in coastal areas, and Minneapolis reported sparse snow and a slow start to its winter sports season.  In the San Francisco District, hotel occupancies have returned to normal in Hawaii but have been low elsewhere.  Demand for airline services generally remained weak, although Dallas noted that holiday travel for some airlines was better than expected. Real Estate and Construction  Residential construction activity and home sales remained at high levels in most Districts, although there were numerous reports of slight cooling in market activity.  Reported activity was strongest in the Richmond District, where growth in home sales remained strong and the housing market was described as ""tremendously active.""  Market activity was down somewhat in the Boston, New York, Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, due in part to normal seasonal slowing.  St. Louis indicated that home demand may be leveling off.  In Atlanta, home sales fell in December after an increase in November. Construction activity was at ""low levels"" in the Dallas District, although lower-priced homes (below $250,000) sold ""briskly.""  Boston, Atlanta, and Chicago also reported stronger demand for mid- and entry-level homes and condominiums than for more expensive residences.    The markets for commercial real estate continued to exhibit substantial slack in all Districts.  Richmond and St. Louis described demand for office and industrial space as ""sluggish"" or ""slow,"" while office vacancy rates increased slightly in Minneapolis-St. Paul, the city of Chicago, and parts of the Kansas City District.  In the Cleveland District, commercial building activity remained at low levels, but builders reported a significant increase in the number of prospective projects.  Minneapolis reported low vacancy rates for retail space and a corresponding increase in planned retail construction.  Although San Francisco reported a decline in office vacancies in Los Angeles, contacts from that District and Dallas expect little overall change in commercial construction activity over the next two years. Agriculture and Natural Resources  Agricultural output and performance was mixed across Districts, as adverse weather conditions hampered agricultural production activity in some areas.  Chicago reported high yields and high prices for a variety of crops.  There and in the St. Louis District, the value of farmland rose markedly, and bankers in the Kansas City District reported good credit quality for their farm loan portfolios.  San Francisco noted improved sales of agricultural products, due in part to increased overseas demand spurred by the weaker dollar.  By contrast, Minneapolis reported deterioration in performance in the agricultural sector.  Moreover, heavy rain and otherwise inclement weather limited yields and production activity for a wide variety of crops in the Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas Districts, while lack of moisture is likely to limit yields for the winter wheat crops in Minneapolis and Kansas City.    Activity in the energy and mining sectors was flat or up slightly on net.  Mining activity in the Minneapolis District continued at high levels.  Minneapolis and Kansas City reported no change in extraction activities for oil and natural gas, and Dallas reported only a slight increase, despite a sharp rise in the prices of oil and natural gas.  In addition, Dallas noted that inventories of natural gas and crude oil were well below year-earlier levels.     Financial Services and Credit  Loan demand was up on net, mainly reflecting strength in consumer and real estate lending.  Business loan demand remained somewhat depressed in the Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts, and it fell further in Dallas.  Kansas City reported a slight weakening in all loan categories and tightened credit standards.  By contrast, Philadelphia reported modest increases in all categories.  Contacts in New York and St. Louis saw a pickup in commercial and industrial loans, with New York reporting tightened credit standards for that category.  Household loan demand remained strong in most areas, especially for home financing. However, household loan demand fell a bit in Atlanta, and both demand and quality were quite weak for household loans in Dallas.   Employment and Wages  In most Districts, firms remained very cautious in their hiring decisions and most categories of labor were in ample supply.  Continued layoffs in a variety of industries were reported in several Districts, most notably St. Louis and San Francisco. The labor market in New York was described as ""slack"" overall, despite a reported increase in hiring of temporary services workers.  Among Districts, only Minneapolis reported some tightening in labor markets.  In Cleveland, labor markets were ""stable.""  Upward wage pressure was described as ""subdued"" in Chicago and Kansas City and restrained by a weak labor market in San Francisco.  Minneapolis reported modest wage increases (about 2 percent) compared with a year earlier, and Boston noted that some firms plan to ease restrictions on pay increases in 2003.  Kansas City noted that the only categories of labor in short supply were health-care workers and some construction tradesmen, and Atlanta reported double-digit yearly wage increases for hospital workers.  Contacts in Atlanta and Minneapolis cited sharp increases in employer costs for employee health coverage.  Chicago and San Francisco reported that firms are responding to increased health costs by passing on a portion to employees through rising direct contributions or reductions in other components of compensation.   Prices  Despite rising costs for energy and other inputs, upward movement in the prices of final goods and services was quite limited.  Chicago noted rising input costs for steel, packaging, and electronic components, but pointed to ""fierce competition"" as the main factor holding down prices for final goods.  Kansas City also pointed to rising materials costs for manufacturers, although it noted that steel prices fell recently and prices of finished goods continued to decline. Several Districts reported a sharp increase in fuel costs in December.  As noted by Dallas, however, stiff competition limited the impact of rising energy costs to reduced profit margins on some intermediate goods rather than increased prices of final goods.",2003-01-15
9,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago based on information collected before February 24, 2003. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.      Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts generally suggested that     growth in economic activity remained subdued in January and February. Only a     few Districts reported any notable changes from the last Beige Book. In particular,     Richmond indicated that economic activity ""grew modestly"" and Kansas City noted     ""some signs of strengthening;"" by contrast, New York said that the regional     economy had ""generally weakened."" Many reports indicated that geopolitical and     economic uncertainties were constraining consumer and business spending and     tempering near-term expectations.   Consumer spending remained weak, on balance, with a few Districts noting a     little improvement and others indicating a slight deterioration. Business spending     was very soft, with little change in capital spending or hiring plans. Nearly     all Districts indicated that real estate and construction activities were mixed,     with strength on the residential side and weakness on the nonresidential side.     Most Districts still described manufacturing activity as weak or lackluster,     although half of the reports noted at least some degree of improvement. Refinancing     activity continued to drive growth in household loans, while business loan demand     remained weak. Contacts in most Districts expressed concern over rising energy     and insurance costs, but noted that businesses had difficulty passing along     much, if any, of the cost increases to their customers. The agricultural sector     continued to be affected by poor weather in many Districts. Mining and energy     extraction activity picked up, but energy production was limited by supply problems     and some shortages of skilled labor.   Consumer Spending and Tourism     Overall consumer spending remained weak during January and February. Retail     sales were generally flat throughout much of the country in January. Boston,     Chicago, and Kansas City reported some signs of improvement during February,     but severe winter weather over the Presidents Day weekend hampered shopping     in the New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond Districts. Apparel sales were mostly     weak, although discounting helped move merchandise in some areas. Reports on     home furnishings were mixed. Valentine's Day merchandise sold well in a few     Districts, and terrorism fears boosted the sales of duct tape, plastic, and     other hardware goods in some regions. Retail inventories were generally low     and in line with both current sales and merchants' conservative near-term expectations.     New light-vehicle sales were down from year-end 2002 levels; new vehicle inventories     were high for some product lines, and incentives remained elevated. Tourism     and travel reports were mostly favorable. Richmond said that tourist activity     strengthened. Atlanta reported a gradual improvement in overall tourism and     continued strength in cruise activity through Florida ports. Kansas City noted     that traffic to Rocky Mountain ski resorts remained solid. San Francisco reported     that domestic and international travel to Hawaii improved, but was below expectations.   Business Spending     Business spending remained very soft, as geopolitical concerns and uncertainty     over the strength of demand continued to constrain spending and hiring plans.     Capital expenditures remained sluggish, with most Districts noting little change     in recent months. Cleveland and Atlanta noted particular weakness in manufacturers'     current capital outlays. Boston and Chicago reported that information technology     spending was weak, with Boston noting further softening, particularly for telecom-related     software and services. By contrast, Dallas indicated a slight improvement in     information technology sales, with one contact noting an increase in orders     for replacement hardware such as routers, computers, and monitors. While businesses     in much of the country remained cautious about their plans for capital spending     in coming months, a survey of Philadelphia District manufacturers indicated     that about 25 percent of respondents planned to increase outlays while only     10 percent planned decreases. Reports of demand for legal and accounting services     were mixed, while three Districts indicated some softening in advertising.   Most Districts reported that businesses were still very cautious about hiring     permanent workers, though Cleveland and Atlanta noted a pickup in the use of     overtime and part-time employees. Nearly half of the District reports suggested     that manufacturing industries were reducing their payrolls, and two said that     retailers were downsizing as well. State fiscal woes were cited as contributing     to layoffs in the Minneapolis and Kansas City regions. Staffing services firms     generally continued to report soft demand. A large employment agency in New     York noted that hiring for midlevel office jobs had been on the rise late in     2002, but had since dropped off. However, Dallas reported improved demand for     temporary workers in administrative, light industrial, and professional and     technical positions, and Richmond saw scattered increases in manufacturing.   Construction and Real Estate     Nearly all Districts indicated that real estate and construction activities     remained mixed, with strength on the residential side and weakness on the nonresidential     side. New and existing home sales remained strong in nearly all Districts, with     only Dallas reporting that activity was soft. Housing demand generally appeared     to be strongest for low- and moderate-priced units. Demand for higher-priced     homes remained softer, although Richmond and Chicago noted slight improvement     in some areas. None of the Districts reported a general improvement in commercial     real estate markets, and three suggested slight deterioration. Most regions     said that net new demand for office space remained very weak. Vacancy rates     continued to rise somewhat and downward pressure on rents persisted. Philadelphia     and Richmond indicated that office-leasing activity picked up as existing tenants     renegotiated with landlords for lower rents and/or concessions. Boston also     reported an increase in leasing activity, largely due to consolidations. Cleveland     noted that state and local fiscal difficulties were having an impact on public     construction projects, and St. Louis reported that several announced hospital,     church, and college projects have been delayed due to economic uncertainty.     Most reports suggested that there were few, if any, expectations of a near-term     improvement in commercial real estate and building activities. Cleveland, however,     noted an increase in demand for architects' services, which contacts suggested     could be a precursor to increased commercial building activity.   Manufacturing     Manufacturing activity generally remained weak nationwide, but half of the reports     noted at least some degree of improvement. Richmond indicated that ""activity     strengthened"" as ""shipments and new orders rose sharply,"" and Kansas City said     that ""activity improved slightly."" Only St. Louis suggested a slight deterioration,     with increasing reports of weak sales. Light-vehicle production nationwide was     flat-to-down from a year earlier, and adverse weather in mid-February led to     some plant shutdowns in the Cleveland District. Reports from vehicle parts suppliers     were mixed. Firms in the St. Louis District reported diminishing orders for     automobile parts, but Atlanta suggested that businesses supplying parts to the     new vehicle assembly plants in the region were outperforming other manufacturers.     Demand for some high-tech goods was said to be improving. Conditions in the     semiconductor industry appeared to improve in the Boston and San Francisco Districts.     Dallas added that there was an increase in the demand for some high-tech consumer     goods. Apparel makers in two Districts reported better conditions. Manufacturers'     inventories of finished goods and raw materials were generally lean, as contacts     across the country expressed high uncertainty about the near-term outlook.   Banking and Finance     Lending activity was mixed by market segment. Most Districts indicated that     growth in household lending continued to be driven by very strong residential     mortgage demand. Refinancing was again spurred by lower fixed-rate mortgage     interest rates; one contact in the Richmond region indicated that every 1/8     percentage point to 1/4 percentage point drop in mortgage rates brings in new     people. Demand for other types of consumer loans was generally flat-to-down.     A few Districts noted slight increases in delinquencies and defaults on some     household loans, while one reported slight improvements in loan quality. Standards     for household loans were largely unchanged. However, bankers in the Dallas region     said that the quality of loan applicants was lower, and Philadelphia suggested     that marginal borrowers were finding it more difficult to service their debts.   Business lending activity remained weak in most of the nation, as many bankers     suggested that decisionmakers were reluctant to borrow in the face of continued     uncertainty surrounding geopolitical and economic conditions. Atlanta reported     that the bulk of commercial lending activity was driven by businesses refinancing     existing loans. However, bankers in the Philadelphia, Richmond, and Chicago     Districts saw slight increases in some commercial lending segments. Bankers     in one-third of the Districts reportedly tightened standards on some business     loans. There were few indications that overall quality on commercial loans had     changed in recent weeks, although bankers in the Philadelphia District noted     ""some slippage in credit quality,"" while Chicago bankers suggested modest improvement.   Prices and Employment Costs     A combination of geopolitical uncertainties, very harsh winter weather in the     eastern half of the country, and lean inventories led to significantly higher     energy costs in January and February. These cost increases were having wide-ranging     economic impacts throughout the country--higher raw materials costs for manufacturers,     increases in transportation and shipping costs, fuel surcharges, and even job     cuts in manufacturing in the Atlanta region. Dallas reported that ""gasoline     prices at the pump reached the highest February level on record,"" while one     Chicago contact suggested that small freight haulers may be driven into bankruptcy     by very high diesel fuel prices.   Upward wage pressures remained generally subdued in nearly all Districts, but     some nonwage costs continued to rise, particularly for health and other insurance.     Minneapolis reported that two large unions had agreed to pay a portion of their     health insurance premiums in order to get 3.75 percent pay raises in each of     the next two years.   Few firms said they were able to pass along much, if any, of these cost increases     to their customers. Competition from both domestic and foreign producers helped     keep final goods prices in check. Most Districts suggested that price pressures     at the retail level remained largely subdued, with many merchants still resorting     to heavy discounts to move merchandise.   Agriculture and Natural Resources     Agricultural activity remained mixed across Districts. San Francisco reported     that the decline in the value of the dollar gave a boost to agricultural exports.     Farmland values in the Chicago District posted the largest year-over-year gain     since 1997. Higher prices for many agricultural commodities boosted planting,     notably for winter wheat in part of the Minneapolis District. Cotton yields     hit a record in Texas, and cotton plantings in the mid-South are expected to     be higher this year. Increased livestock prices have eased profitability concerns,     though reduced herds due to drought could lead to a smaller calf crop this year.     The drought reportedly affected agriculture in nearly half the Districts, increasing     the need for timely precipitation in the spring. On the other hand, Atlanta     and Dallas reported favorable moisture levels. Cold weather had a negative impact     on agricultural activity, stressing livestock in several regions, slowing field     work in the Richmond District, and causing moderate frost damage in portions     of the Atlanta District. Low prices continued to affect the dairy industry,     even the most efficient producers. Financial stress has increased in the Chicago     District, but few significant farm loan portfolio problems were reported by     bankers elsewhere.   Due to higher prices, activity in the energy sector increased, though not evenly.     Kansas City and San Francisco reported strong oil and natural gas activity.     However, Dallas noted only a mild increase and Minneapolis said energy activity     was mixed. Current and potential disruptions to crude oil supplies continued     to hamper refining, especially in the Dallas District. Dallas also reported     that activity was held down by industry perceptions that the oil price increase     was temporary and by a shortage of trained workers. Higher metal prices helped     spur mining activity in the Minneapolis District.",2003-03-05
10,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and based on information collected before April 15, 2003.  This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of the Federal Reserve officials.     Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggested that the pace of     economic activity continued to be lackluster during March and the first two     weeks of April. Although Richmond observed continued modest growth, reports     from Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco characterized     economic conditions as still mixed or soft. Since the last Beige Book, New York,     Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City noted that the recent pace     of economic activity had been slower than reported earlier. The onset of the     war with Iraq appeared to have some effect on sales and spending, although it     is too early to ascertain the full effect of the war on both consumer and business     confidence.   Reports on consumer spending were generally weak in March, but respondents     attributed part of the weakness to poor weather and the onset of war. Contacts     also cautioned that year-over-year comparisons of sales for March were difficult     because Easter fell in late March last year but falls in the third week of April     this year. Optimism remained that the retail environment would improve within     the next six months.   Most Districts continued to report weakness in manufacturing, although some     pockets of growth were noted in most of the reports. Businesses continued to     report a cautious attitude toward spending, and commercial real estate was reported     to still be in a slump. In contrast, homebuilding activity remained strong across     all Districts. Mortgage lending, buoyed by refinancing activity, remained strong,     and a few Districts noted some improvement in commercial loan demand. Agriculture     conditions generally improved as rain and snow eased drought conditions in several     Districts. Labor markets remained soft, but some Districts noted moderating     layoffs or improvements in demand for temporary labor.   Consumer Spending     Overall consumer spending remained subdued in March. Although some of the weakness     is attributable to Easter falling later this year, the onset of military action     in Iraq and poor weather also had negative effects on March sales figures in     most Districts. Atlanta and San Francisco, however, noted that March sales were     ""near year-ago levels"" and ""largely stable on net"" respectively.   Although retail sales have been sluggish, most Districts indicated that their     retailers were not concerned about inventory levels. Cleveland, Atlanta, and     Chicago reported heavy discounting or increased promotional environments. The     outlook among retailers in Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and St. Louis suggested     that at least a slight improvement in conditions would occur in these Districts     before the close of 2003.   Reports regarding automobile sales in March were mixed: The Cleveland, Richmond,     Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco auto markets saw some rebound     in March after slowing in February. Philadelphia, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and     Kansas City, on the other hand, reported faltering auto sales in March, although     Minneapolis and Kansas City saw some recovery in auto sales in early April in     response to manufacturers' incentives.   Travel and tourism spending strengthened in the Richmond, Minneapolis, and     Kansas City Districts, but slowed in the Chicago and San Francisco regions.     San Francisco noted that international travel had weakened, due in part to the     SARS outbreak in Asia. Dallas observed a decline in air travel due to the onset     of the war and the SARS outbreak. Atlanta reported mixed conditions: Although     international tourism fell in the District, the decline was offset by a successful     spring break season.   Manufacturing    Nine of the twelve Districts reported slowing activity in manufacturing. New     York and Dallas reported mixed conditions, and Cleveland reported flat or slightly     improving conditions. In general, contacts reported lower levels of production,     sales, and new orders.   Still, pockets of improvement in the industry were noted by more than half     the Districts in this report. In Boston, companies producing hardware, semiconductors,     and machine tools reported an increase in business activity, as did nondurable     goods producers in the Cleveland District. Atlanta's defense-related manufacturers     reported improving conditions, and the hiring of temporary workers in manufacturing     rose slightly. In the St. Louis District, some auto parts producers were planning     to expand their facilities. The energy-related sector in Dallas observed strong     growth since the last report. Despite declining conditions at the time of the     survey, manufacturers in the New York and Philadelphia Districts seemed optimistic     that activity would improve somewhat within the next six months.   Construction and Real Estate     Residential activity remained strong while commercial building activity continued     to be characterized as sluggish. Most Districts reported high levels of residential     building activity and sales. Still, some homebuilders suggested that there was     a slight softening in their markets: In the Boston District, sales were being     limited by supply, and in New York and Atlanta, demand for higher-end homes     had eased.   On the commercial side, weakness in construction activity persisted as none     of the Districts reported solid improvements in the industry. Office vacancy     rates continued to climb in the New York, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis,     Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, and some Districts reported     falling rental prices.   Banking and Finance    Home lending activity, fueled mainly by refinancing, remained strong across     all Districts, but the Chicago District noted some slowing in mortgage activity.     Consumer and commercial lending was generally flat, although some bankers in     the Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts saw slight increases     in commercial loan demand. Several Districts reported growth in deposits, but     New York reported a decline. Richmond noted a decline in consumer credit demand     as clients were paying down their debts.   Agriculture    Recent precipitation has helped to allay fears of continued drought in the Richmond,     Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Farmers in the Kansas City District     expected to strengthen their balance sheets if relief from drought conditions     continues. Various Districts reported stable or rising commodity prices for     items such as sugar cane, vegetables, cattle, cotton, tree fruits, and nuts,     but prices for milk remained low. The Atlanta and Chicago Districts reported     that higher energy prices have resulted in higher market prices for farming     inputs, but in Chicago it did not appear to have a large effect because most     farmers had negotiated contracts when input prices were lower.   Labor Markets    Most District reports indicated continued weakness in labor markets, as several     Districts noted substantial layoffs in March and early April. Still, some hints     of improvement had emerged: Both Cleveland and Kansas City reported fewer plans     for staff reductions, while New York, Atlanta, and Dallas reported stronger     demand for temporary workers. Several Districts reported a lack of upward pressure     on wages, but firms continued to note substantial increases in the costs of     health care and insurance.   Prices    Many Districts reported price pressures in specific segments of their economies,     and no reports of widespread inflationary pressures were mentioned. In general,     energy-related inputs in manufacturing saw substantial price increases in March     and early April, but most manufacturers held the prices of their goods steady.     Retailers noted heavy discounting and promotions, with notable drops in apparel     and electronics prices.",2003-04-23
11,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and based on information collected before June 2, 2003. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.       Although reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated some signs of increased economic activity in April and May, conditions remained sluggish in most Districts. No District report suggested that economic conditions had deteriorated since the last Beige Book. Economic activity increased or showed signs of improving in the Dallas, Kansas City, New York, and Minneapolis Districts. The Philadelphia and Cleveland reports characterized activity as mixed, while other Districts generally saw sluggish, subpar, or subdued economic growth. The unwinding of war-related concerns appears to have provided some lift to business and consumer confidence, but most reports suggested that the effect has not been dramatic.   Consumer spending remained lackluster overall. Retail sales rebounded as the hostilities in Iraq subsided, but sales remained below the level of a year ago. Manufacturing activity was mixed, with some Districts reporting signs of improvement since the last Beige Book but others still seeing declines in orders. Service sector reports, although limited, suggested sluggish activity overall. Low mortgage rates continue to stimulate residential construction and home sales in most Districts, but commercial construction and real estate markets were still weak. The energy industry continued to strengthen. Agricultural production was impaired by wet weather in some areas. Most Districts continued to report weakness in labor markets and some downward pressure on wages, although benefit costs continued to increase. Consumer Spending  Overall consumer spending was soft in April and May. Retail sales picked up some after subdued sales in March, but most reports indicated that sales remained below the level of a year ago. A few Districts noted that retail sales did not pick up as much as expected after the winding down of hostilities in Iraq. Wet weather was blamed for having damped sales in the Chicago, Cleveland, New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond Districts, but the very recent wet weather had a positive effect on foot traffic and sales in the Boston District. Most Districts indicated that inventories are in line with expectations, although a few Districts said inventories were on the high side, particularly apparel.   The outlook for consumer spending was described as cautiously optimistic. The Boston District reported that most contacts are less concerned about economic uncertainties than in previous months and anticipate that sales will increase modestly in the next few months. Retailers in the Richmond and Kansas City Districts also expressed optimism about sales in coming months, noting that they are planning to hire summer help. However, contacts in the Dallas and Philadelphia Districts expressed caution that sales would not pick up significantly until employment conditions improve.   Lower selling prices were reported by the Dallas, New York, and Philadelphia Districts, and widespread promotional activity and discounts were reported by the Atlanta District. The Boston and Dallas Districts noted that retailers continue to focus on ways to reduce their costs and become more efficient--using such strategies as improving their marketing, investing in faster cash registers, and increasing the use of part-time workers.   Auto sales were mixed in April and May. Sales weakened since March in the Chicago, New York, and San Francisco Districts but improved in the Atlanta, Kansas City, and Philadelphia Districts. Sales were below the level of a year ago in the Boston, Cleveland, Kansas City, Philadelphia, and St. Louis Districts. Most Districts reported that dealer inventories have risen above desired levels. Some new incentives have been added, but contacts in the Philadelphia and Cleveland Districts suggested that consumers do not appear to be as responsive to the current offers as automakers and dealers had hoped. Manufacturing  Manufacturing activity remained mixed. Three Districts--New York, Minneapolis, and Cleveland--reported an increase in manufacturing activity in April and May although three others--Philadelphia, Richmond, and Boston--indicated deterioration since the last report. The remaining six Districts reported little change from conditions that continued to be characterized as ""sluggish,"" ""weak,"" ""soft,"" or ""mixed.""  Still, four of those Districts reported signs of improvement or optimism about future activity.   Boston, Atlanta, and Dallas noted that production related to defense and construction activity remained among the bright spots in the manufacturing sector. San Francisco noted strong demand for advanced technology production. Energy-related manufacturing activity in the Dallas District remained relatively strong.   At the same time, the Richmond District's traditional manufacturing industries--textiles and furniture--recorded particularly sharp declines in April and May. The Chicago District reported that automakers said sales of light vehicles slowed nationwide in May, and inventories remained high; Cleveland noted a sharp cutback in motor vehicle production. The Chicago and Cleveland Districts also reported that, despite an increase in demand for specialty steel, steel shipments slowed early in the second quarter. Due to limited demand for new planes by the airlines, the San Francisco District reported that production of commercial aircraft has dropped to the lowest levels since the mid-1990s. Services  Airline traffic has steadily increased in recent weeks, according to the Dallas District but, with airline capacity abundant, expectations are for a summer with low fares and intense competition. Airlines are carrying fewer passengers than a year ago and are continuing to cut costs through additional layoffs.   The Cleveland District reported that demand for trucking and shipping was flat in May compared with April and slightly lower than one year ago. In the St. Louis District, business has picked up recently for midsize to large trucking firms because several smaller firms have gone out of business. The Dallas District reported an improved outlook for trucking companies and an increase in rail shipments. Contacts in the San Francisco District note that fears about the spread of SARS had no discernible affect on overseas shipping activity.   District reports on the temporary employment industry are mixed. In the Boston District, half of the temporary employment firms contacted reported an improvement in business in the first quarter, with demand for workers in health care and selected financial services up, but light manufacturing still weak. In the New York District, an employment agency specializing in office jobs has also seen a pickup. Temporary staffing firms in the Dallas District report that demand has steadied. However, the vast majority of temporary help industry contacts in the Chicago District said that new orders fell in recent weeks, and those in the Richmond District reported lukewarm demand for workers in recent weeks.   Reports on tourism and travel activity were also mixed. Tourism activity was soft in the Minneapolis District, declined modestly in the Richmond District, but picked up seasonally in the Boston District. In Chicago, tourism remained fairly steady, and hotel occupancy rates improved slightly in some areas. Although tourism was weaker than expected at Rocky Mountain ski resorts in the Kansas City District, summer bookings at family destinations are solid. Concerns about the SARS epidemic in East Asia reduced business and leisure travel in the San Francisco District in recent weeks. In the Atlanta and San Francisco Districts, increases in domestic tourism helped offset a decline in the number of overseas arrivals. Hotels in the Atlanta District continue to struggle because of the low volume of business travel. The Dallas District reports that hotel industry occupancy is 4 percent to 5 percent below a year ago. p>     Construction and Real Estate  Residential real estate markets and construction activity strengthened in the Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, and St. Louis Districts and was still ""solid"" in the Minneapolis District. In some instances, sales growth was very strong. For example, in April and May, many homebuilders in the Cleveland District reported sales increases of more than 10 percent over the high level of sales one year ago. In some areas of the Richmond District, home sales in recent weeks displayed ""unprecedented strength,"" including real estate agents reporting their best sales growth in more than twenty-five years. However, inventories of unsold homes in late April and May were higher than a year ago in cities in the Kansas City District and were at record levels in Denver. In the Dallas District, new home building continued to lose steam, and sales of existing homes were very weak--contacts there say that it will take new jobs and increased confidence to stimulate demand for new homes.   Overall commercial real estate continues to be weak, with only scattered indications of conditions stabilizing at a low level. The Boston District has seen high and rising office vacancy rates and falling rents. Office vacancy rates have also edged up in suburban Philadelphia. Nonetheless, both Districts reported an increase in purchases of office buildings by institutional investors and real estate investment firms. New York's office market has shown signs of improving recently, after having weakened in the first quarter. Brisk leasing activity in Lower Manhattan--largely from the health sector--pushed that area's vacancy rate down sharply to its lowest level in one year. Commercial leasing and construction activity in the Richmond District was generally flat in recent weeks, but the retail sector was one of the bright spots in recent weeks. Banking and Finance  Lending activity continued to increase, mostly for refinancing residential mortgages. The Chicago District reports that many households appear to be taking advantage of refinancing to pay down other debt, which is limiting growth in credit card balances. Business lending increased in the Dallas, Cleveland, and Philadelphia Districts, but was weak in the Atlanta and Chicago Districts and in most of the San Francisco District. The Richmond District reports no signs of a pickup in commercial lending any time soon.   Most Districts reported little change in loan delinquencies. The Cleveland District noted a few reports that credit quality had slipped, and bankers in the Philadelphia District expect commercial loan quality to slip in the second half of the year because revenue growth for many business borrowers has been weaker-than-expected. However, the Chicago District indicated that the credit quality on commercial loans was improving modestly, while the San Francisco District reported that the credit quality of bank loans was generally stable to slightly improved. A mild increase in residential mortgage foreclosures was reported in the Atlanta District, while the Dallas District reported a May spike in home foreclosures in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Banks in the St. Louis District reported that they had tightened lending standards for small firms. Agriculture and Natural Resources  Wet weather delayed spring planting and other farm activity in the Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, Richmond, and St. Louis Districts. The heavy rains damaged crops in some areas, such as in the Richmond and St. Louis Districts, where contacts expressed concerns about reduced crop quality. But the moisture was welcomed in the Atlanta, Chicago, and Minneapolis Districts, where rainfall improved the outlook for yields. Conditions remain too dry in the Dallas District, where cotton planting was delayed because of insufficient moisture to germinate seed. The San Francisco District noted that sales were strong for beef cattle and for most crops, in part because the depreciation of the dollar boosted demand. The Atlanta District reported a bumper winter wheat crop. The Chicago and Minneapolis Districts reported that milk prices are very low.   The energy industry continues to strengthen, according to the Dallas, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts. Drilling activity picked up in response to robust demand for oil and natural gas. Contacts in the Dallas and Kansas City Districts expect drilling and related activity to continue to grow through the end of the year. The Minneapolis District reported a decline in the region's mining sector, with the closing of an iron ore mine due to financial difficulties and disruptions to production and shipments at other plants. Labor Markets  Most District reports continued to indicate that labor markets were soft. In the Kansas City District, the pace of layoff announcements continued to ease, but layoffs continue at some large employers in the Dallas District and at some manufacturers in the St. Louis District. A few employers in Cleveland continued to report layoffs, but most indicated plans to augment or maintain their workforces. In the Atlanta District, firms are not yet hiring permanent employees but are leveraging existing staff by increasing hours and, or adding temporary personnel. In the New York District, a major employment agency specializing in office jobs reports a noticeable pickup in hiring since the last report.   District reports suggested little pressure on wages, although benefit costs continued to increase. In the Chicago District, contacts reported that many firms were instituting wage freezes and, or limiting or delaying merit increases. The Dallas District reported downward wage pressure in several industries, although some contacts said that the labor market had not eased sufficiently to allow the wage reductions they would desire. Service firms in the Boston and Dallas Districts report that downward pressure on fees has depressed pay rates. In the Kansas City District, wage pressures remained subdued, but some managers reported that their average wages had risen over the past year because lower-paid junior workers were laid off. Respondents in the San Francisco District noted very limited upward pressure on wages overall. Several Districts reported a continued rise in the cost of employee health benefits, particularly insurance. Prices  Anecdotal reports suggest that price pressures are mixed, with no widespread inflationary or deflationary pressures. Lower prices were reported for crude oil, fuel, and some manufactured products. Prices also continue to be soft for many retail products. However, there were reports of rising cost pressures for tuition, state taxes, transportation, and all types of insurance. Natural gas prices rose, pushing up prices of most petrochemical products to record levels. The San Francisco District noted that depreciation of the dollar has led to higher costs for some imported raw materials and textiles.",2003-06-11
12,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and based on information collected before July 21, 2003.  This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.       Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve districts provided additional signs that the pace of economic activity increased a notch during June and the first half of July.  Only the Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco districts characterized economic activity as sluggish while Atlanta described conditions as mixed.  Reports from the remaining districts suggested somewhat stronger growth in the weeks since the last Beige Book.  Consistent with the generally more positive assessments of current economic activity, several districts noted increased optimism about economic prospects in coming months.   In particular, manufacturing activity edged higher in most districts, and Philadelphia and Richmond cited an end to the recent declines in production.  The districts' reports also suggested that activity in the services and energy sectors grew somewhat faster in recent weeks.  In contrast, consumer spending remained lackluster-only New York reported a noticeable improvement in retail sales.  Housing sales and starts remained strong across districts, spurred by low mortgage interest rates, but commercial real estate conditions remained sluggish.  Prices were generally little changed, though higher health insurance costs continued to be passed on to employees according to some districts.  In agriculture, excessive rainfall delayed harvesting and damaged crops in several districts but was credited with alleviating drought conditions in other districts. Consumer Spending and Tourism  Retail sales were mixed across districts since the last Beige Book report.  Sales improved noticeably in the New York District, while sales in the Atlanta, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia districts, sales posted slight to modest gains.  In contrast, sales revenues were said to be flat in the San Francisco District, lackluster in the Chicago District, and below year-ago levels in the St. Louis District.  Among categories, apparel sales were weak in the Boston, Cleveland, and Philadelphia districts, but were higher in the New York and Richmond districts.  Richmond also reported stronger sales of home merchandise, hardware, and building supplies.  In the Chicago and Philadelphia districts, customers were said to be buying less expensive brands of merchandise.  Retailers in the Atlanta, Dallas, New York, and San Francisco districts cited heavy discounting and noted that retail prices remained competitive.  Retail inventories in the Atlanta District were described as low and balanced, but in the Dallas and St. Louis districts, some retailers reported excess inventories.   Reports on automobile sales across the districts were mixed.  Sales were flat to lower in the Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, St. Louis, and San Francisco districts.  Sales were steady in Philadelphia and Richmond, but were mixed in Atlanta.  In the Kansas City District, motor vehicle sales improved in areas outside of Colorado, and Minneapolis reported that automobile sales were above year-ago levels.  Contacts in several districts said new vehicle inventories were above desired levels.  Dealers in the Kansas City District reported record-high inventories, but they expected the inventories would be drawn down in coming weeks.   Tourism and travel reports were also mixed in June and the first half of July.  In the Chicago District, hotel occupancy rates were boosted by discounts and economy packages.  Boston said that international travel more than doubled compared to last year, but the report indicated that travel industry expectations were not met because activity still trailed pre-9/11 levels.  Likewise, early summer travel in the Atlanta District fell short of industry expectations even though a large cruise line in South Florida reported a recent spike in bookings and projected a robust second half.  Kansas City indicated that passenger traffic rose at most airports in its District and that convention business in Denver was strong. Manufacturing  Nascent signs of a recovery emerged in the manufacturing sector with 10 of the 12 district reports indicating mixed, steady or slightly improved conditions after an extended period of declines.  Atlanta and St. Louis suggested continued softness in the sector, with both reports citing increasing plant closings and layoffs.  Reinforcing the view of stronger conditions in manufacturing, nine of the twelve districts were optimistic about prospects for the sector over the next six months.  Despite the stronger tone, prices of manufactured products remained soft.   Chicago's report noted that nationwide light vehicle production was ""pretty good"" through mid-July and that heavy equipment orders edged up, in part because of a weaker dollar.   San Francisco reported that new orders in the information technology sector strengthened, reducing inventory levels.  Suppliers to the defense and military industry in the Cleveland and Atlanta districts continued to report strong orders, while Boston and Dallas noted a pickup in demand for personal computers and computer hardware.  Philadelphia added that demand increased for residential construction materials and orders rose for printing and industrial machinery components.   But weakness persisted in some segments of the manufacturing sector.  Richmond and Atlanta reported that textile shipments continued to fall, Atlanta reported layoffs at an aircraft engine plant, and Boston noted weakness in the aerospace industry.  Cleveland indicated that auto production fell further though the decline was smaller than in previous months.  Chicago said that demand for steel remained soft and Dallas reported that energy-related manufacturing activity was softer.   On balance, capital expenditures in the manufacturing sector remained weak, although several districts reported an increase in investment planned for the future.  Atlanta reported that firms remained reluctant to buy new equipment. Kansas City indicated that recent capital spending fell but that planned future investment edged up, as optimism about manufacturing prospects remained high.  Boston and Dallas noted increases in capital spending for upgrades in hardware and software, while Philadelphia said that manufacturers planned to increase investment, though some firms indicated they would likely delay expansion until next year.  St. Louis reported that several plants in that district have recently announced plans to expand. Services  Ten districts reported increased demand in the service sector during recent weeks.  Demand for legal services increased in the Dallas, New York, and San Francisco districts, and Philadelphia said demand for technological expertise and business consulting rose.  In the San Francisco District, contacts reported stronger demand for high-tech and real estate services.  Atlanta, Boston, and New York reported a pickup in the demand for finance and insurance services and the Dallas report suggested stronger corporate finance and acquisitions activity. Construction and Real Estate  Residential real estate activity remained strong in most districts in June and early July.  Atlanta, Kansas City, and St. Louis said housing sales continued to rise while Boston, Cleveland, and Richmond reported that sales remained strong.  Chicago indicated that overall sales activity was mixed.  In contrast, Dallas indicated that the housing market remained weak.  In terms of price levels, lower-priced homes continued to be the best sellers in the Boston, Dallas, and Richmond districts and sales of upper-price range homes held up in the Boston and New York districts.  Richmond reported that home prices soared in Maryland in recent months and San Francisco said prices rose rapidly in Hawaii and southern California.  However, home price increases moderated in the Boston and Cleveland districts.  Residential building permits increased in the Cleveland, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and St. Louis districts. Kansas City said strong starts of entry-level homes offset weak starts of upper-priced homes. Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco reported that low mortgage interest rates continued to drive sales in their districts.   Commercial real estate conditions remained weak in most districts during June and early July.  Very little new construction activity was noted-an exception was in the St. Louis District where construction activity had begun to pick up before being delayed by inclement weather.  Commercial leasing activity also remained generally stagnant, although renewals and renegotiations drove some activity in the Chicago District.   In contrast to the overall sluggishness, Atlanta reported small increases in leasing and net absorption.  Compared with the last Beige Book reports, vacancy rates edged higher in the Kansas City, New York, and San Francisco districts and were higher compared with a year ago in the St. Louis District.  Chicago and New York reported that rents moved lower, and Richmond indicated that landlord concessions had reemerged in the office and retail sectors.  However, several district reports noted pockets of improvement-leasing activity was up in the Atlanta and Minneapolis districts along with a substantial decline in vacancy rates in Lower Manhattan.  Looking ahead, Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City, Richmond, and St. Louis reported that their contacts expected the excess commercial space currently on the market to be absorbed slowly. Banking and Finance  Lending activity was mixed across districts in June and early July, as solid residential mortgage demand was accompanied by weak demand for commercial loans.  Most districts characterized residential mortgage demand as either increasing or continuing strong.  Dallas reported a surge in mortgage lending because borrowers were anticipating rising mortgage interest rates and wanted to lock in the current low rates.  Demand for commercial loans, however, was described as weak in the Atlanta, Chicago, and New York reports, and as declining in the Kansas City report.  Philadelphia reported that bank lending to businesses had increased, but that the rate of growth remained slow as most business borrowers apparently saw little need to expand their operations.   Several districts reported little change in credit quality.  Philadelphia said that credit quality was not currently a problem, but added that some banks believed a further deterioration in business conditions could lower the credit quality of commercial loan portfolios.  Kansas City noted that some bankers had expressed concern that declining used car prices had lowered the credit quality of their automobile loan portfolios. Prices and Wages  District reports suggested that price and wage inflation remained  broadly in check, although increases were noted in the energy, transportation, and insurance industries.  Atlanta reported that health care insurance premiums rose at a double-digit rate in June and early July.  The rising costs of employee benefits, most notably health insurance and pensions, boosted non-wage labor costs in the Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City, and San Francisco districts.  Most district reports described wage increases as minimal, and Kansas City reported that firms were providing no more than cost-of-living increases.  Contacts in Dallas and Kansas City noted that rising benefit costs were being passed on to employees, and San Francisco reported that higher labor costs could restrain hiring in the near-term.   Prices charged by manufacturers were generally unchanged in Boston, Cleveland, and Kansas City, but Chicago reported some firming resulting from the weaker dollar.  On the flipside, prices paid for materials by manufacturers were mixed.  The Boston, Cleveland, and New York districts noted stable input prices, but moderate price hikes were reported in Dallas, Kansas City, and Richmond.  Agriculture and Natural Resources  Unusually heavy thunderstorms saturated wide areas of the Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas districts in June and early July, damaging crops, delaying planting, and slowing harvesting activity.  Atlanta reported reduced fieldwork in many areas as a result of Tropical Storm Bill.  Because of the wet weather, Richmond noted that fewer acres of soybeans will be planted and that some of the wheat crop will not be harvested.  Dallas said that hail damaged cotton in the Texas Panhandle and Chicago reported damage to some crops from severe storms.  Despite the damage, Chicago said corn and soybeans were generally in good-to-excellent condition.  By contrast, several districts noted that the abundant spring rains had beneficial effects.  The rains eased drought conditions in much of the Kansas City District, returned the soil moisture to normal levels in St. Louis, and improved crop conditions in Minneapolis.  Agricultural prices were mixed.  The San Francisco District noted that crop and livestock prices had remained firm and that a lower exchange value of the dollar had boosted export activity.  Minneapolis and Chicago, however, reported that milk prices remained soft.   Activity in the energy industry remained strong according to reports from the Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco districts.  Minneapolis indicated that oil and natural gas exploration levels increased, while Kansas City reported that energy activity was steady in June and early July after increasing markedly during the first five months of the year. Dallas added that the level of drilling activity moved to new highs but noted that the rate of increase had slowed substantially in recent weeks, as producers tried to assess the storage situation for natural gas this summer.  Kansas City reported that the end of a moratorium on new coal-bed methane drilling permits in Wyoming led to predictions of increased production of natural gas in coming months.",2003-07-30
13,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and based on information collected before October 7, 2003.  This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.      Information received from District Banks suggests that, on balance, the pace of economic expansion has picked up since the last report.  Ten of the twelve districts indicate that activity has been expanding, while two--Boston and Cleveland--report mixed but steady levels of economic activity. Overall, both wages and prices of finished goods and services remained relatively stable, though there were scattered reports of business input cost pressures.  Hurricane Isabel inflicted some limited damage across much of the Richmond District, but the disruptions to activity from the storm were said to be short-lived.     Consumer spending generally strengthened, though most districts report a recent pullback in auto sales.  Improving sales trends are reported in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Retail inventories are generally described to be at or close to desired levels, and retailers generally anticipate modest year-over-year gains for the upcoming holiday season.  Most districts report strengthening in manufacturing activity.  Employment in this sector remained generally weak, though some districts note pockets of firming.     Broad-based strength is reported in residential real estate and construction, but commercial real estate markets are still described as sluggish.  Travel and tourism activity was mixed but, on balance, showed some improvement.  Reports from most other service industries also show improvement.      Banks in almost all districts report a substantial drop-off in refinancing activity since the last report, though there were a few reports of improvement toward the end of September.  There was some pickup in business loan demand, while home mortgage and consumer lending were mixed.  Credit quality was generally described as good, with only scattered reports of increased delinquency rates.  Most districts report favorable weather conditions and improved agriculture yields since the last report, though Richmond reports significant crop damage from Hurricane Isabel.     Labor markets generally remain slack, but some signs of a pickup are reported in New York, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas.  Prices of finished goods were generally stable, and wage increases continued to be quite modest, though many districts note continued escalation of non-wage benefit costs--particularly health insurance.  Also, fairly sharp price increases are reported for cattle and certain commodities, such as steel, lumber, plywood, and natural gas.    Consumer Spending    Most districts report a general strengthening in retail sales but some softening in automobile purchases.  A few districts credit the recent federal tax rebates with temporarily boosting sales, though the timing of the effect on sales varied.  Non-auto sales are generally said to be improving in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco, while Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago describe sales as steady or moderating but still ahead of plan.  Boston and Richmond characterize sales as flat but with some pockets of strength.  Richmond reports that sales lost due to hurricane-related closures were quickly made up, and that hardware stores, grocery stores, and restaurants saw brisk business after the storm.      Recent reductions in motor vehicle sales are reported in most districts.  Automobile sales are said to have weakened in the Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts.  St. Louis, on the other hand, reports some improvement in vehicle sales in recent weeks, though they were still lower than a year ago.  Also, sales of imports are said to be holding up better than those of domestic makes in the St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts.    Non-auto inventories are generally reported to be in good shape in almost all districts, but vehicle inventories are said to be higher than desired in Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis.  Looking ahead to the rest of 2003, retailers in most districts are reported to be cautiously optimistic.  Modest sales growth is anticipated in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City, while the remaining districts did not specify sales expectations.     Manufacturing    The majority of the districts report a pickup in manufacturing activity, with several indicating significant improvement in a wide variety of industries.  Machine tool orders strengthened in the Atlanta and Chicago Districts; semiconductor producers note a pickup in demand in the San Francisco District; contacts in lumber and construction related materials see improvement in several districts; and high-tech manufacturers in the Dallas District indicate gains.  On the downside, Richmond reports a contraction in its manufacturing sector, and contacts in Boston report weak demand and a decline in revenues. The Minneapolis District notes only slight gains, and the Dallas and Cleveland Districts report mixed activity.  Kansas City, Boston, and St. Louis report a decline in activity in the aerospace industry, and several districts indicate marked deterioration in the textile industry.  Activity in the transportation equipment industry was mixed, with declines noted in the Philadelphia District, little change in Chicago, but increases in St. Louis. Several districts report a continuing low level of inventories, and most contacts report that input prices remain high, and above year-ago levels, but have not accelerated further since the last report.     Manufacturing employment exhibited modest gains in some districts, but in most was stable or declining. The Kansas City, Cleveland, and New York Districts report increases in hours worked, and Kansas City, New York, and St. Louis report hiring gains. Capital spending activity was mixed, with contacts in several districts reporting plans to increase capital spending, while the majority of contacts from other districts cite hesitation and lackluster spending plans going forward.    Real Estate and Construction    Residential real estate markets continued to show strength in virtually all districts, while commercial real estate markets remained generally sluggish.  Virtually all districts describe housing markets as robust, despite relatively modest signs of slowing in the Boston, Richmond, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts.  On the other hand, signs of further strengthening are noted in New York, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City.  A few districts specify that the recent increase in mortgage rates appears to have had at most a limited impact on home sales.  Reports from Boston, New York, Chicago, and Kansas City note particular strength for entry-level or lower- to mid-priced homes, as opposed to the high end of the market.      Residential construction is also indicated to be strong in most districts.  Recent increases in construction activity are reported in New York, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Minneapolis. Kansas City notes that builders have had trouble obtaining plywood, while reports from Boston, New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, and San Francisco indicate sharp increases in lumber and plywood costs, which, in turn, are said to be squeezing builders' profit margins.   Commercial real estate markets, in contrast, continue to be characterized as weak in almost all districts.  Still, a number of districts indicate slight signs of firming since the last report--specifically New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas.  On the other hand, renewed signs of slowing are reported from Chicago and Minneapolis, while conditions are described as stagnant in Richmond and San Francisco.      Tourism and Services    Tourism and travel activity was mixed but, on balance, improved; however, both business travel and international visitors were still lagging, although there were some scattered signs of recovery.  Overall, tourism was described as robust in New York, Kansas City, and San Francisco but sluggish in the Boston District.  Since the last report, New York and San Francisco report a pickup in international visitors, while Boston, Minneapolis, and Kansas City note some pickup in business travel.  On the other hand, Atlanta describes both of these segments as persistently weak.  Richmond reports that Hurricane Isabel caused substantial hotel damage and widespread cancellations along much of the Virginia and North Carolina shore. The evacuations from the storm resulted in a noticeable pickup in business at hotels in less affected parts of the district.    Business conditions in other service industry sectors varied but generally improved. Increased demand for various business-related services (such as legal, accounting, IT, and executive search) is noted in Philadelphia, Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco.  Increases in trucking are reported in Cleveland, while Dallas indicates a decrease in trucking volume but an increase in rail shipments, and New York reports strong increases in port traffic.  Boston reports mixed to firmer conditions in the insurance industry, with industry contacts reporting little financial impact from the August blackout and expressing optimism about the business outlook.   Banking and Finance    Banks report mixed but generally favorable conditions.  Loan demand is generally steady overall, with some improvement from the commercial sector, but steep declines in mortgage refinancing. Demand for commercial loans strengthened in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco, and was little changed in New York.  While none of the districts indicates weakening in business lending, a few characterized the level of activity as still low.  Demand for consumer and home mortgage loans was steady to weaker in New York, Cleveland, and Richmond, but some firming was indicated in Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City.  Most districts report sizable declines in mortgage refinancing activity, though Dallas indicates persistent strength in this category, while Chicago and Minneapolis report a slight bounceback in late September.      Loan quality is generally described as good, with delinquency rates little changed since the last report.  Chicago and Dallas report some improvement in loan quality and Atlanta says that loan delinquencies ""remained manageable,"" while Philadelphia cites an increase in debt-service to income ratios, and New York indicates an uptick in delinquencies on consumer and home mortgage loans.     Aside from lending, financial institutions report favorable conditions and brisk growth.  New York's securities industry reports strong growth in revenue, profits and compensation.  Similarly, financial institutions in the Dallas District report a pickup in mergers and acquisition activity, leading to higher fee income.  Finally, San Francisco suggests that a recent acceleration in business deposit in-flows further reflects a pickup in general economic activity.     Agriculture and Natural Resources    Most districts report favorable weather conditions and improved agriculture yields since the last report. However, Hurricane Isabel wrought significant damage in the Richmond District. A combination of flooding, high winds, and power outages resulted in damage to crops, fruit, livestock, and fishing equipment in much of the Richmond District.  Otherwise, recent rains have improved crop yields in the St. Louis, San Francisco, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Chicago Districts. These rains, however, caused spotty problems for fall planting in some districts. Suppliers from all cattle-producing districts report banner prices, decent pasture conditions, and are optimistic that profits will follow suit.    Activity in the energy industry was mixed. The Minneapolis District indicates a slight decline in oil and natural gas exploration levels since the last report, while the Kansas City District reports a moderate expansion in oil and gas drilling. The Dallas District reports that activity remained at a relatively high level, but was not quite as strong as might be expected given the current price of oil and natural gas.   Labor Markets, Wages and Prices    Most districts continue to describe labor markets as slack, though there are modest signs of improvement in a number of districts.  In general, labor markets are characterized as stagnant in Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San Francisco.  On the other hand, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas report increased demand for temporary workers, while New York reports a pickup in hiring across a number of sectors.  Both New York and Chicago note that much of the hiring is coming from smaller firms.  Kansas City notes some decrease in layoff announcements, as well as an increase in hiring plans.      Modest wage growth is reported across the nation, though continued escalation in non-wage benefits, particularly health insurance, are noted in Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco.  Rising benefit costs are said to be holding down wage increases in the Atlanta District and deterring hiring in Dallas.     The various districts report little change in prices of consumer goods and services, but steep escalation in certain commodity prices.  Retail prices are reported to be stable in Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco; steady to slightly higher in Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Kansas City; and steady to slightly lower in Boston, New York, and Dallas.    In contrast with the general price stability for finished goods and services, prices for a number of commodities have risen sharply.  Steep increases in lumber and plywood costs are noted in Boston, New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco--some of this is attributed to post-war rebuilding in Iraq, post-hurricane repairs along the Mid-Atlantic seaboard, and fires in the West that affected supply.  There were also reports of steep price increases for cattle, steel, and natural gas.  However, oil and gasoline prices have retreated, following a sharp run-up in August.  In terms of intermediate services, a noticeable increase in freight costs is reported in the Minneapolis District, but declines in commercial rents are seen in Richmond, Chicago, and Minneapolis.",2003-10-15
14,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and based on information collected before November 17, 2003.  This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.       Reports received from the District Banks suggest that the economy continued to expand in October and early November.  Descriptions of the pace of growth varied somewhat.  But improvements appeared to be reasonably broadly based, with most districts noting growth in a number of industries.  Overall, wages and prices of finished goods and services remained fairly stable, although some increases in input prices were noted.  Virtually all districts continued to report concerns about rising health care costs.      The majority of districts noted that retail spending was up on a year-over-year basis.  Expectations for holiday retail sales were reported as generally positive.  Reports on auto sales were mixed, with sales results closely linked to manufacturers' incentives. Travel and tourism activity improved overall, as did other service sector industries.     Manufacturing activity picked up in most districts, but few noted employment gains in the factory sector.  Almost all districts characterized residential real estate activity as strong, but commercial real estate markets remained weak.  Reports from the banking sector generally indicated subdued loan demand and some increase in investment banking activity.  Agricultural conditions were good in most reports, while activity in energy-related industries was mixed.  Labor markets conditions generally stabilized after an extended period of weakness.  Several districts noted a slowing in layoffs and stronger demand for temporary workers.    Consumer Spending  Reports on retail spending were generally positive, although some weakness was attributed to unseasonably warm weather in several parts of the country.  Boston, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis and Kansas City indicated that sales exceeded year-ago levels, while San Francisco described sales as ""solid.""  Philadelphia said that sales were rising in early November after weak results in October, and Richmond noted recent improvements as well.  Dallas and Cleveland indicated that sales growth remained uneven, while New York and Chicago described sales as soft.  New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Chicago stated that warm weather put a damper on sales, particularly of apparel.  Atlanta and San Francisco reported some discounting.  Most districts said that inventories were well positioned, with many retailers keeping stocks lean.     Discussions of retailers' expectations for the holidays were generally positive.  New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta and Kansas City said that holiday sales are expected to match or exceed last year's levels, while St. Louis and Minneapolis reported that retailers are optimistic.  Kansas City said that retailers expect strong holiday sales while Boston, Cleveland and Chicago reported mixed expectations.  New York and Minneapolis reported that retailers expect to hire similar numbers of seasonal workers as last year, whereas Kansas City indicated that many retailers plan to increase seasonal hiring.     Reports on auto sales were mixed across districts.  Removal of generous factory incentives reportedly drove down sales in the Atlanta, Minneapolis and San Francisco districts; St. Louis noted that the incentives might have shifted sales into the summer from the fall.  Chicago also indicated that sales weakened.  Philadelphia, in contrast, reported a pickup in sales in early November because of new manufacturers' incentives after a ""relatively sharp"" drop in sales in October; Cleveland similarly noted that sales were tied to incentives.  Kansas City reported that despite aggressive manufacturer incentives, sales improved more for used cars than for new cars.  Boston reported strong sales of imported models but mixed results for domestic models.  Several districts noted that manufacturers are expected to roll out new incentive programs to boost sales in the coming months.    Tourism and Services   Activity in the tourism and hospitality industry improved moderately overall, according to most reports, but business travel remained subdued and international tourism was still weak.  Early snows and cold conditions in ski areas pushed up demand in the San Francisco district.    New York reported that occupancy rates at Manhattan hotels were up noticeably from a year ago.  Minneapolis reported ""generally solid"" tourism activity.  According to Richmond, coastal areas were still recovering from damage caused by Hurricane Isabel, but mountain areas were booked almost to capacity for the Thanksgiving holiday.  Atlanta reported increased traffic at amusement parks and tourist attractions in central Florida because of deals and discounts; south Florida's cruise industry continued to report strong numbers, and advance bookings at resorts and hotels are reportedly encouraging.  San Francisco noted that the number of international visitors to Hawaii remained soft, but the weaker dollar is expected to boost traffic in coming months.       Business conditions also generally improved in other service industry sectors.  Boston and San Francisco said that demand for software products improved; the outlook for software and IT services moved from cautious to optimistic, according to Boston.  Richmond reported steady demand at professional, scientific, and technical service firms and higher demand at environmental services firms.  In the San Francisco district, demand for professional services such as accounting, securities, and legal services stabilized after months of contraction.  Richmond, St. Louis and San Francisco reported continued strong demand for healthcare services.  Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta and Dallas reported increases in transportation services.  In general, increased seasonal freight was the main contributor to recent growth in land transportation.    Manufacturing  Manufacturing activity improved in most districts.  Factory expansion was broad based in the Richmond district, with firms in almost all sectors reporting higher shipments, while Chicago said that new orders remained strong or were up for medium- and heavy-duty truck and construction equipment manufacturers.  Dallas, Boston, San Francisco and Minneapolis noted positive reports among manufacturers of various high-tech products.  Demand increased for building materials suppliers in the Atlanta and San Francisco districts.  Cleveland reported that automakers and some steel producers increased activity and that most nondurable producers there indicated ""little if any"" spare capacity.  Higher levels of capacity utilization were also noted in the Kansas City district.  St. Louis reported that the manufacturing sector showed signs of improvement despite some plant closings and layoffs.  Less positively, Dallas reported continuing overcapacity in the petrochemical industry, and Atlanta and Richmond noted weakness in textile or apparel production.  Weak demand for paper products adversely affected manufacturers in the Boston, Atlanta and Dallas districts.     Factory employment growth remained weak, according to a majority of districts.  Boston reported that most manufacturers expect to hold domestic employment fairly flat in coming months.  Cleveland, Richmond and Atlanta stated that permanent staffing levels were little changed.  Dallas said that productivity growth and outsourcing continued to slow factory job growth.  However, New York indicated modest increases in factory employment.  Capital spending plans have changed little in recent months in many districts.  Chicago noted that spending was mainly for repair and maintenance of existing equipment.    Real Estate and Construction  Residential real estate markets continued to show strength in virtually all districts.  Home sales and construction maintained a brisk pace in most districts.  However, Richmond and Atlanta noted some easing in recent weeks.  Dallas relayed concerns about rising housing inventories in several areas, with homebuilders offering increased incentives.  Chicago reported that the mid-priced housing market softened somewhat from earlier reports but that some areas experienced a small uptick in luxury housing markets; Kansas City noted mixed results for high-end construction.  Residential activity is expected to remain robust overall into next year, by most accounts.     Most districts once again characterized commercial real estate markets as currently weak.  However, the outlook was a bit more upbeat, with strengthening anticipated next year in many districts.  Vacancy rates remained at high levels across most markets; however, there were scattered reports of small improvements in leasing or construction activity in the New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis and San Francisco districts.  St. Louis noted ""booming"" hospital construction.  Richmond reported a ""noticeable increase"" in office and retail leasing but sluggish activity in industrial space.  Philadelphia, Boston and Kansas City reported generally stable markets.  Kansas City, St. Louis, Minneapolis and Dallas noted expectations of more favorable markets in some areas next year.    Banking and Finance  Loan activity was subdued in most districts.  St. Louis and Chicago reported little change in overall lending activity.  Loan demand was characterized as flat by Richmond, slowly increasing by Dallas and mixed by Cleveland.  Outstanding loan volume moved up slowly in the Philadelphia district in November, and some banks there were limiting their residential real estate lending to prevent mortgages from becoming too large a portion of their loan portfolio.  New mortgage originations were fairly strong in the Philadelphia, Chicago and San Francisco districts.  Refinancing activity slowed in all districts that commented on mortgage lending.  Commercial and industrial loan demand was said to have edged up in the Kansas City and Richmond districts, to be unchanged in Dallas and to have remained at low levels in Atlanta and San Francisco.  Loan quality remained good in most districts, and New York said that delinquency rates declined across the board.  Lending standards were generally unchanged, according to most reports.     Financial institutions reported mixed results in other activities.  New York and Atlanta said that deposit growth held steady, while San Francisco reported a pickup.  Kansas City reported that all types of deposit accounts rose except for large CDs, but Cleveland noted slower growth in core deposits.  Merger and acquisition activity began to rise from low levels in the Chicago and Dallas districts.  Philadelphia said that demand for business financing prompted an increase in investment banking activity, while venture capital firms were beginning to evaluate start-up projects in the Atlanta district.  However, Dallas reported that there was still ""not a lot"" of IPO activity.    Agriculture and Natural Resources  Favorable weather and improved market conditions continued to benefit farmers and ranchers in most districts reporting on agricultural activity.  Mild, dry weather boosted farm production in Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis and Kansas City districts.  San Francisco also noted increased yields, while Chicago and Minneapolis reported improved conditions for most agricultural products.  Kansas City and Dallas reported that market conditions were mostly good for cattle ranchers, but dry weather hurt cotton growers in the Dallas district.     Reports on energy-related industries indicated mixed conditions.  Richmond noted that economic conditions in Central Appalachian coal fields were ""favorable,"" with higher capital investment in new mining equipment expected.  Minneapolis reported that activity in the energy and mining sectors was stable, and Kansas City reported that energy activity was strong.  Dallas noted seasonal cutbacks in production by refineries and continued excess capacity in onshore rigs and a pickup in international drilling.  Natural gas providers in the San Francisco district are reportedly fully stocked for the winter season.    Labor Markets, Wages and Prices  Labor markets across the nation generally improved or remained stable, with several districts noting a slowing in layoffs.  Stronger demand for temporary workers was noted by Boston, Richmond and Minneapolis; Chicago added that the higher demand for temps was widespread.  Several districts indicated that firms are waiting for sustained increases in orders before hiring permanent workers, although Boston reported some increases in permanent placements by temp agencies.  Firms had difficulty finding some specialized workers in the Kansas City district, but labor markets remained slack there overall.  Dallas and San Francisco also reported slack labor markets, although Dallas did note fewer layoffs.  Minneapolis also reported increased hiring plans in some areas.  Labor markets remained steady in the Cleveland and Atlanta districts as a whole, with few signs of impending increases in employment.     Wage pressures were mostly subdued, although almost all districts reported concerns about escalating health and other insurance costs.  Several districts noted that employers were shifting more health insurance costs onto employees, with Kansas City adding that some small firms are eliminating health insurance entirely.  Dallas cited rising health insurance costs as a factor, making firms reluctant to add new employees.  New York reported that bonuses in the securities industry are expected to be 20 percent higher than last year.     Increases in some commodity prices were noted.  Several districts noted higher prices for plywood and steel, and Kansas City also reported price increases for brick and cement.  Dallas noted higher prices for primary metals, while Chicago reported a rise in prices for some heavy equipment and gypsum wallboard.  Boston noted concern about upward price pressure due to higher transportation costs after new trucking regulations are implemented, while Dallas said that the regulations might also make it more difficult to hire drivers.  San Francisco noted that residential rebuilding after the recent fires in Southern California is likely to boost prices of building materials and wages of construction workers.",2003-11-26
15,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and based on information collected before January 6, 2004. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.       Reports from Federal Reserve Districts suggest that the nation's economy has continued to improve since the last survey.  The strongest report came from the San Francisco district, which said its economy expanded soundly.  Most other districts also gave quite favorable reports, saying their economies improved, strengthened further, or grew at a moderate pace.  However, Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas reported only slow or modest growth, and St. Louis said conditions were mixed.  Retailers and manufacturers reported that prices were generally steady despite increases for raw materials.     Holiday retail sales were generally positive across the country, and auto sales either improved or held steady in most districts.  Manufacturing activity increased in nearly all districts, and New York, Philadelphia, and Kansas City noted some growth in factory employment.  Housing remained strong, particularly in the Boston and San Francisco districts.  Commercial real estate was still weak, although a few districts reported signs of firming.  Travel and tourism activity increased considerably, and gains were reported in most other service industries as well.  Bank loan demand was flat or slightly lower, with credit quality generally unchanged.  Energy and agricultural activity was steady in most districts, although the appearance of mad cow disease created considerable uncertainty in the cattle industry.         Along with the increase in overall economic activity, many districts reported modest improvements in labor markets.  These improvements took the form of reduced layoffs or modestly increased hiring, although new hiring was still quite minimal in several districts and most types of workers remained easy to recruit.  Health care and other employee benefit costs  continued to rise.  However, with labor markets still slack, wage pressures remained generally subdued.  Retail prices were generally flat, with some districts reporting less discounting of holiday retail prices than in previous years.  Manufacturers in most districts also held their selling prices steady, despite substantial increases in the prices of some raw materials such as steel and natural gas.    Consumer Spending  Reports on holiday retail sales were generally upbeat across the country, particularly for sales during the last two weeks of 2003.  San Francisco gave the strongest report, saying robust sales led to considerable year-over-year gains.  Holiday sales were also quite solid in the Boston, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Kansas City districts.  Most other districts reported more modest year-over-year sales growth, although some of these districts noted an improvement in sales at the end of December.  Cleveland, on the other hand, said retailers were generally disappointed by sluggish sales during the holidays.  All districts reporting on store inventories said stock levels were generally in good shape for 2004, and all districts reporting on expectations for future retail sales anticipate continued improvement in the months ahead.     Looking across product categories, sales of high-end items were characterized as especially strong in several districts, including New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and San Francisco.  Likewise, electronics and home furnishings sold well in many districts.  On the other hand, sales of apparel were reported to be soft in the Philadelphia and Cleveland districts, and San Francisco noted heavy discounting at lower-priced apparel stores.  Indeed, sales at discount stores in general were reported to have been below plan in several districts, including New York, Cleveland, and Kansas City.       Reports on auto sales were also generally positive, with most districts reporting either steady or improving sales at the end of the year.  Cleveland, St. Louis, and Minneapolis characterized new vehicle sales as ""strong"" or ""solid"" in December, although St. Louis reported that sales of used cars were not as robust as sales of new cars.  Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco all noted some improvement in vehicle sales from previous months, while Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas said sales were mixed or flat.  Philadelphia noted that a seasonal slowing in auto sales resulted in a buildup of inventories, and dealers in the Cleveland district were worried about their ability to sell all of their 2003 models.  Otherwise, though, districts reporting expectations for auto sales were generally optimistic about 2004.    Manufacturing  Nearly all districts reported increases in manufacturing activity in December, and several districts noted that factory employment had begun to edge up as well.  Chicago reported broad-based improvement across manufacturing industries, and Dallas and San Francisco said factory activity increased in a variety of sectors.  Philadelphia, Richmond, and Kansas City noted strong orders in December, and Boston said several firms had been ""pleasantly surprised"" by recent increases in orders.  Factory employment was reported to have posted modest overall gains in the New York, Philadelphia, and Kansas City districts, and factory jobs also reportedly picked up in select industries or for select occupations in the Boston, Richmond, and San Francisco districts.      Looking across industries, primary metal manufacturing was said to be improving in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Richmond districts, and production of various high-tech goods continued to rebound in the Boston, Dallas, and San Francisco districts due to increased capital spending by customers.  Several districts also noted increases in the production of industrial machinery, building materials, and transportation equipment.  On the negative side, St. Louis reported layoffs in the biotechnology, food, and tobacco industries.  Petrochemical producers suffered from overcapacity in the Dallas district and continued to lay off workers in the Atlanta district.  In addition, producers of paper goods in the Boston and Philadelphia districts reported some weakness.       Manufacturers across the country generally expect factory conditions to continue to improve in the months ahead, and several districts noted that capital spending in 2004 will be somewhat higher than in 2003.  Much of the increased spending will go towards replacement of outdated IT and other capital equipment, but both Chicago and Kansas City reported a few firms plan plant expansions as well.  Exceptions to the optimistic outlook included textile producers in the Boston and Richmond districts, who continue to suffer from excess capacity.    Real Estate and Construction  Residential real estate activity remained robust, with home sales and new construction reported to be strong in most districts.  In the Boston district, home sales in Massachusetts continued to rise at double-digit rates, while housing activity in other parts of the district returned to more normal levels following boom conditions during the last two years.  In the San Francisco district, home sales increased and home price appreciation remained solid.  In most other districts, home sales and single-family homebuilding were reported to be holding steady at high levels.  The only districts reporting some slowdown in overall housing activity were Chicago and Dallas.  Contacts in the Chicago district said some easing was inevitable given the previous boom, but Dallas reported that high inventories of existing homes were becoming a concern.  Both Boston and Kansas City reported that the high-end market was weaker than the entry-level market, although tentative signs of a turnaround in high-end construction were noted in Kansas City.  The multifamily market remained weak in the few districts reporting on this sector, the only bright spot being a modest recovery in apartment rents in New York.     Commercial real estate activity remained weak, although there were signs of improvement in a few districts.  In most districts, commercial real estate markets and nonresidential construction were described as soft with little improvement expected in the near term.  Commercial builders in the Cleveland district viewed 2003 as a weak year and did not expect conditions to improve for at least the next six months.  In the Chicago district, vacancy rates remained elevated in most segments of the market, and contacts saw no indication of a firming in demand at the end of the year.  On a more positive note, however, a few districts reported either a pickup in activity or improvement in expectations for the future.  For example, Atlanta reported that commercial construction activity was still generally weak but that leasing activity continued to improve.  In the Dallas district, the office market remained soft, but contacts were increasingly optimistic that the worst was behind them.  The strongest report came from the Richmond district, where contacts were highly encouraged by a pickup in leasing activity late in the year.     Tourism and Services  Travel and tourism activity improved substantially.  Boston, Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City and San Francisco all reported a surge in visitors to ski resorts due to very good snow conditions, while Atlanta noted increased optimism about winter tourism in Florida and New Orleans.  Boston also reported a positive outlook for international bookings due to the lower dollar and promotional airfares.  Demand for hotel rooms in New York remained strong, as brisk leisure travel activity more than compensated for a continued slump in business travel.  In other reports on business travel, Atlanta observed a modest increase in convention bookings, while Boston noted increased spending on corporate entertaining and higher bookings for corporate meetings in 2004.     Activity in other service industries generally expanded as well.  Several districts reported increased demand for freight transport services.  For example, Cleveland observed busy trucking activity serving retailers, Dallas reported increased rail shipments of lumber due to strength in construction, and San Francisco noted that exports and holiday imports kept several seaports operating at capacity.  Looking at other sectors, Dallas reported robust growth in legal services, Philadelphia noted improved demand at marketing firms, and New York cited unusually brisk hiring for office jobs.  Boston reported little change in overall demand for insurance, with slightly higher sales of long-term care products but lower revenue from large-property insurance.  On a negative note, Richmond indicated lackluster activity at several business support and technical firms.    Banking  Overall demand for bank loans either remained unchanged or declined somewhat in most districts.  Home mortgage lending continued to fall due mainly to lower refinancing activity.  Banks in the Chicago district reported that new mortgage originations were also slowing somewhat, although such lending remained fairly strong.  Demand for consumer loans fell somewhat in the New York and St. Louis districts and rose in the Philadelphia and Kansas City districts.  Business loan demand increased in the Philadelphia, Richmond, and St. Louis districts but held steady or weakened in other districts.  Banks in the Richmond district attributed the increased demand for business loans to the stronger economy and were optimistic about lending prospects for 2004.  In the Chicago and San Francisco districts, banks reported more inquiries about lending terms from small businesses, even though overall business lending remained flat.     Credit quality and lending standards were little changed in most districts.  Credit quality was described as stable in the Philadelphia district, although some banks reported higher defaults on consumer loans.  Banks in the New York district reported fewer delinquencies in all loan categories except business loans.  In the Chicago district, business loan quality improved, but home mortgage loan quality eroded slightly.  The only changes in credit standards were in the New York district, where they were tightened slightly for non-mortgage loans, and in the Chicago district, where some large banks were said to be loosening standards on business loans in an effort to boost lending.    Natural Resources and Agriculture  Activity in natural resource industries generally held steady.  Ore mining in the Minneapolis district continued at a strong pace, as some mines produced near capacity while other, previously shut, mines reopened.  Energy activity in the Dallas district was little changed, but contacts noted continuing excess capacity in the oil services and machinery industry.  Oil and gas drilling in the Kansas City district remained unchanged at levels considerably higher than a year ago, while Minneapolis reported a decrease in both oil and natural gas exploration.  Looking ahead, natural gas producers in the Kansas City district plan increased capital spending in anticipation of continued strong production, but contacts in both the Kansas City and Dallas districts expect some decline in oil production in coming months.     While most districts reported steady conditions in the farm economy, the appearance of mad cow disease created substantial uncertainty in the cattle industry.  Farm incomes were supported in the Chicago district by strong hog production and by rising corn and soybean prices, while incomes in the Kansas City district were maintained by high soybean prices and still-elevated cattle prices.  In the San Francisco district, farmers benefited from strong holiday sales of cut flowers and Christmas trees.  Crop conditions in the Atlanta and Dallas districts were reported as stable.  However, farmers in some parts of the Minneapolis and Kansas City districts continued to suffer from drought, and Richmond reported harvest and planting delays due to excessive precipitation.  The emergence of a case of mad cow disease in Washington state resulted in a great deal of uncertainty for cattle ranchers.  Contacts in several districts noted substantial declines in cattle prices due to foreign bans on U.S. beef exports.  The uncertainty was causing ranchers in the Kansas City and Dallas districts to take a wait-and-see approach toward herd adjustments.  San Francisco, on the other hand, reported that the appearance of mad cow disease was boosting sales of range-raised beef.    Labor Markets, Wages, and Prices  Most districts reported modest improvements in labor markets in December.  San Francisco noted a pickup in hiring, Minneapolis reported more hiring announcements than layoff announcements, and Kansas City said layoffs dropped considerably.  Likewise, demand for temp workers increased in the Philadelphia and Richmond districts, and Chicago said the seasonal decrease in temp employment this year was less than in the previous two years.  On the other hand, hiring was said to be quite minimal in several districts.  Cleveland, for example, noted that most firms still do not plan to increase payrolls in the near future.  In addition, while hiring improved somewhat in the Atlanta district, firms generally remained reluctant to add full-time staff.  Both Kansas City and Dallas noted some pickup in demand for high-tech workers, although such workers were still easily recruited in the Kansas City district and some types of high-tech and telecom work in the Dallas district continued to be outsourced overseas.  Acute labor shortages were generally reported only for select health care fields, with some hospitals in the Atlanta district recruiting overseas to fill open nursing positions.     Wage pressures generally remained subdued throughout the nation, but most districts continued to report greater upward pressure on health care and other employee benefit costs.  Chicago, Kansas City and San Francisco described wage increases as ""weak"" or ""modest"" and Boston stated that wages were mostly stable.  Exceptions were reported in the Dallas district, with wages subject to downward pressure in the airline industry but upward pressure in certain occupations such as skilled mechanics.  Meanwhile, districts consistently reported that employee benefit costs continued to increase.  San Francisco said that the improving job market was making it harder to shift increases in health care premiums to workers, resulting in slightly higher growth of total compensation.     Most districts reported little change in final goods prices, but costs of some raw materials rose noticeably.  Retail prices were generally stable.  Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco all reported less discounting of holiday retail prices than in previous years, although a few other districts said holiday discounts were similar to last year.  In manufacturing, the most widely cited increase in raw materials costs was for steel.  Contacts in the Cleveland district said steel producers were raising prices to cover the increased cost of their own inputs, such as scrap and iron ore, and that steel prices were likely to continue rising through the first quarter.  Price increases were also reported in some districts for copper and aluminum.  In the Boston district, prices of lumber and plywood were reported to have fallen back somewhat from the highs reached in the third quarter, but contacts in other districts said these prices were still well above year-ago levels.  In most districts, manufacturing firms were reported to still be having difficulty passing input costs on to their customers.  In the Dallas district, petrochemical producers held their selling prices steady in the face of sharply rising natural gas prices, and trucking firms kept their rates unchanged despite higher fuel costs.  The only signs of a change in pricing power were in the New York and Kansas City districts, where some firming in selling prices was reported.",2004-01-14
16,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia based on information collected before February 23, 2004.  This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a representation of the views of Federal Reserve officials.     Economic activity continued to expand in January and February, according to information received by Federal Reserve District Banks.  Growth was variously described as moderate in Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City, firm in Minneapolis, sound in San Francisco, and showing signs of accelerating in New York, Richmond, and Dallas. Consumer spending rose in most Districts.  There were gains in sales of general merchandise in January and February in all Districts except St. Louis, which reported a slight decline.  In contrast to the general improvement in merchandise sales, motor vehicle sales slowed in most Districts.  Tourism activity increased compared to last winter.  Service sector activity has been expanding.  Manufacturing output continued to rise in all Districts except Cleveland, where it has been steady.  Real estate market conditions showed little change: commercial markets generally remain soft and demand for housing continues to be strong.  Agricultural conditions were mixed: demand for beef appears to be recovering from the effects of mad cow disease but exports of poultry products have been curtailed by the outbreak of avian influenza.  Oil and gas production remain at high levels and iron ore processing has increased.  Bank lending has been growing moderately. Employment has been growing slowly in most Federal Reserve Districts.  Wages and salaries have increased slightly, but employers report substantial increases for employee health-care costs.  Most Reserve Banks reported level or modestly increasing retail prices, but information received from manufacturers and other businesses indicates that commodity prices have moved up more noticeably.  The largest increases have been for steel and for lumber and other building materials.  Shipping charges have also risen recently. Consumer Spending  Retail sales of general merchandise rose in most Federal Reserve Districts in January and February.  Strong or strengthening sales were reported in New York, Richmond, and Dallas.  Sales growth was moderate in Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco.  Retailers in Cleveland said sales met or exceeded their expectations.  Retail sales in Atlanta moderated slightly in February but remained above the level set in February last year.  St. Louis retailers said sales declined slightly relative to a year ago.  Spring apparel was said to be selling well in New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City.  Sales of electronics, appliances, and home furnishings were relatively strong in Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City.  Jewelry was selling well in Atlanta and St. Louis.  Reports on retailers' inventories across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts indicated that store stocks were mostly in line with sales.  Stores were still receiving spring merchandise, but retailers were generally maintaining conservative inventory plans.  Nearly all Districts reported that auto sales slowed during January and February and compared to a year ago.  The exceptions were Boston, where sales picked up in February after falling in January, and Philadelphia, where sales were about steady.  Auto dealers in several Districts attributed the falloff in sales to cold or stormy weather that kept shoppers off the lots.  With the slowdown in sales, dealers' inventories increased. Tourism activity has improved.  Bountiful snowfalls in mountain areas gave a boost to ski resorts, according to Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco.  Richmond and Atlanta reported good business at beach resorts, and in New York and San Francisco hotel occupancy increased compared to last year. Services  Service industry activity moved up in the Districts reporting on this sector.  Boston and St. Louis noted increased demand for information technology services.  St. Louis also indicated that demand for insurance and health-care services increased, but financial services and transportation activity eased.  In the Dallas District, accounting and consulting firms were seeing increased activity compared with the final quarter of last year.  In San Francisco, demand has strengthened for media, high-technology, and health-care services.  In Richmond service sector business was steady to somewhat improved.  Transportation activity has increased in most parts of the country.  National freight companies based in Richmond indicated their business has improved and trucking companies have seen increased activity in Cleveland and Atlanta.  Trucking was said to have slowed seasonally in Dallas, but railroads in the Dallas District noted robust activity.  Trucking companies reported increased costs for fuel and they said labor costs have increased as a result of recent regulations limiting drivers' hours.  Nonetheless, Chicago and Cleveland indicated that sales of heavy trucks have increased. Manufacturing  Manufacturing activity rose during January and February in 11 of the 12 Federal Reserve Districts.  The exception was Cleveland, where factory production rates were said to be steady.  There were notable increases for electronic and electrical equipment in Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Dallas, and semiconductors in Boston and San Francisco.  Cleveland and Chicago indicated that steel production had increased, and Philadelphia and St. Louis indicated that output of metal products had risen.  Production of heavy trucks increased in Chicago, and auto and auto parts production increased in Cleveland and St. Louis, although the increase was said to be seasonal.  Atlanta and Dallas noted increased output of lumber, and Richmond and St. Louis reported gains in furniture production.  Other manufacturing industries in which expanding activity was noted were biopharmaceuticals (Boston), machine tools (Chicago), aerospace (St. Louis), and chemicals (Cleveland and Chicago).  In a few industries reports were mixed.  Food processors posted gains in Dallas but declines in St. Louis.  Richmond District textile producers were gaining business but there were textile plant closings in the Atlanta District.   Real Estate and Construction  Commercial real estate market conditions have shown little change in most Districts.  Continuing high vacancy rates, slowing leasing activity, and downward pressures on rents were reported by Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, and Kansas City.  Conditions in major commercial real estate markets were mixed in the St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts.  Despite the generally slack and unchanged market situation in most parts of the country, a few Districts noted some signs of improvement.  In New York and San Francisco vacancies have moved down slightly and rents have begun to recover.  Leasing activity has picked up in the Washington, DC area of the Richmond District.  Residential real estate markets continued to be strong in the majority of Districts. Although cold temperatures and winter storms interrupted home building in some areas in January, housing demand generally remained high.  Recent gains in home sales and building activity were noted in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco.  In Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City residential real estate activity continued at high levels.  In Richmond the housing market was said to have slowed recently, but builders expect activity to pick up.  Overall, builders and real estate agents in most Districts expect home sales in 2004 to be close to the 2003 sales record.  Home price appreciation was characterized as steady in most Districts with the exception of San Francisco where the rate of increase was said to have slowed somewhat recently. Agriculture  Agricultural conditions have been mixed.  Good citrus crops were reported in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts, although there was some concern in Atlanta that world supplies might exceed demand at current prices.  Beef prices were still declining in Chicago and St. Louis while San Francisco reported that they have firmed and Dallas noted that prices and demand had not been affected as much as expected.  Chicago reported increased prices for corn, soybeans, and milk.  Dry weather in the Kansas City District has adversely affected winter wheat and led some cattle producers to postpone expanding their herds, and ice and snow in the Richmond District has limited grazing there.  The outbreak of avian influenza has curtailed exports of poultry from the Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Minneapolis Districts.   Natural Resource Industries  Federal Reserve Districts reporting on the energy sector noted generally strong, steady conditions in January and February.  Drilling activity has been fairly level in recent months in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts, but Minneapolis noted a slight decrease in exploration activity.  San Francisco indicated that natural gas producers were operating close to full capacity.  Rising worldwide demand for steel has stimulated increased iron ore production.  Minneapolis reported that iron ore producers in that District were operating at full capacity and ore prices were rising.   Financial Services and Credit  In most Federal Reserve Districts lending by commercial banks grew moderately in January and February.  Lending to business firms was rising in Philadelphia, Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco.  In Chicago, lending to small businesses was on the rise while overall business lending was described as flat.  Commercial bankers in Richmond and Atlanta said demand for business loans has been restrained as firms are reluctant to increase capital spending.  Demand for personal loans, including credit cards, appeared to have eased in New York and Philadelphia, remained steady in Dallas, and increased in Chicago.  Mortgage lending declined in Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco, and increased slightly in Richmond and Chicago.  Changes in deposits have been mixed.  Banks in the Atlanta District have generally had steady growth, but growth has slowed in Cleveland and Dallas where bankers think investors are moving money out of bank deposits and into debt and equity market instruments.  Banks in the Kansas City District indicated that their deposit levels have been steady. Employment and Wages  Federal Reserve Districts reporting on employment generally noted modest increases in January and February.  Boston indicated that temporary help agencies were placing more workers in manufacturing, software development, and government.  There has been increased demand for temporary help workers in customer service and sales positions in the Richmond District, in office and health-care jobs in the Dallas District, and for a variety of jobs in the Chicago District.  Employment agencies in New York indicated that they have been experiencing gradual increases in demand, and professional employment agencies in the Washington, DC area of the Richmond District have boosted their own staffs in response to increased business from their clients.  San Francisco District employers in the retail, construction, and agricultural sectors have been increasing their hiring moderately.    Reports on wages indicated that increases continue to be moderate.  However, the rate of increase in benefit costs continues to exceed that of wages.  Medical insurance and workers' compensation insurance fees remain on the rise in most Districts, although the rate of increase does not appear to be accelerating.   Prices  Most Reserve Banks reported fairly stable or slowly rising retail prices in January and February, but accelerating increases in some industrial commodity prices.  Steel prices have increased, and prices of iron ore and scrap metals have risen as well.  Prices of lumber and other materials used in home building were on the rise in most Districts.  Energy prices, especially natural gas, remained high in most Districts and Atlanta noted price increases for petrochemicals.  Cleveland noted rising rates for shipping by truck and Chicago reported rising costs for overseas shipping, primarily due to increased costs for ocean transport.",2004-03-03
17,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and based on information collected before April 12, 2004. This document summarized comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.     Economic activity increased across the nation from mid-February through early April. The growth was widespread as retail sales moved up noticeably, and manufacturing, mining, energy, tourism and services all grew. In addition, new home construction is strong in a number of districts. However, commercial real estate markets remained soft. Lending activity increased and credit quality remained solid. Conditions in the agricultural sector improved overall with higher prices for most products. Meanwhile, labor markets tightened somewhat with modest wage increases. Many districts reported modest increases in overall consumer prices, but most districts indicated significant increases in numerous commodities and input products.    Consumer Spending  Most districts saw a noticeable increase in retail sales. Boston, Cleveland and Philadelphia described sales as improving and strengthening, while sales were moderately above year-ago levels in the Atlanta, Minneapolis and St. Louis districts. Dallas, Kansas City, New York and San Francisco variously described consumer spending as brisk, solid or surprisingly strong. Meanwhile, retail sales growth moderated somewhat in the Richmond district, and consumer spending was somewhat mixed in the Chicago district. Several districts noted increases in apparel sales. Furthermore, many reports indicated that retail contacts were optimistic for growth during late spring and summer.    District reports indicated that vehicle sales were mixed. Minneapolis and San Francisco reported strong sales, and Cleveland, Kansas City, Philadelphia and Richmond described recent vehicle sales as rising or improved. However, some districts noted that sales were constant or down slightly from a year ago. In the Atlanta district auto sales were described as uneven, with strong demand for light trucks and SUVs contrasted with weakness in demand for cars. Chicago, Dallas and St. Louis suggested that automobile sales were soft or slow. A number of auto dealers indicated that inventories were higher than desired.    Tourism and Services   Tourism activity grew in several districts. Atlanta, Minneapolis, New York, Richmond and San Francisco described tourism activity as brisk, solid or at high levels. In the northern part of the Boston district tourism picked up at a moderate pace after a slow start earlier in the year. Meanwhile, Kansas City said that travel and tourism were mixed, and Chicago mentioned that leisure travel was generally flat. Boston, Kansas City, Minneapolis and Richmond indicated that tourism businesses were optimistic for the summer season.    Contacts in other service businesses also noted growth in activity. Chicago and Philadelphia mentioned that information technology firms noted increased demand. Trucking and shipping businesses in the Atlanta, Cleveland and Philadelphia districts reported an increase in activity. Meanwhile, transportation in the Dallas district was mixed, with demand for air travel up, railroads running at near capacity and trucking activity soft. Service providers in the San Francisco district saw further strengthening in demand. However, Richmond reported that customer demand for services, on balance, was flat.   Manufacturing  Manufacturing activity increased in all the districts. New orders and production were up over a year ago. Several districts reported slow growth in capital equipment orders. Nearly all districts noted increased activity across a broad range of industry sectors, especially primary materials. Kansas City reported higher capacity utilization for most manufacturers. Most steel mills were operating at or near capacity in the Chicago and Cleveland districts. Philadelphia indicated that steel and iron supplies were limited. Orders for high-technology products increased in the Dallas and San Francisco districts. Rising material costs were a common theme across the nation, with mixed reports on the ability to pass costs along to consumers by raising prices.    Real Estate and Construction  Commercial real estate markets remained soft. Most districts described conditions as remaining weak or activity as slow. The St. Louis bank said its commercial slump appears to have bottomed out. In contrast, the New York and San Francisco districts continued to see moderate growth in commercial real estate activity.    Residential markets were strong, with some concerns about the rising costs of building materials. Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Kansas City, Minneapolis, New York and Richmond all suggested strong sales, but Richmond noted softening in the Carolinas offset by activity in other markets. Cleveland said sales were on par with the same period last year, and Dallas referred to scattered signs of improvement. Activity slowed in the St. Louis district. Several districts reported mid-priced homes accounted for most of the activity, with recent increased activity in the high-end market.   Agriculture  Overall, agricultural conditions were good across the nation. Prices for most agricultural commodities remained strong. Chicago reported higher prices for corn, soybeans, hogs and beef, and Minneapolis noted record milk prices. Atlanta reported firm prices for vegetables, and San Francisco reported strong demand for nuts. Due to record prices, several districts indicated that farmers plan to plant more acres of soybeans this year. Atlanta, Kansas City and Minneapolis reported dry conditions in parts of their districts, and Richmond indicated that cold weather problems were hampering plantings.   Natural Resource Industries  The energy and mining sectors remained strong. Most districts reported that high energy prices have fostered more exploration and production. Dallas saw growth in onshore drilling but noted continued decline in offshore activity. Kansas City reported an increase in the energy sector from already high levels and noted the increase in drilling has led to shortages of equipment and labor. San Francisco reported high capacity utilization for oil and natural gas extraction as well as electricity generation, with scattered capacity increases. Minneapolis reported oil and natural gas exploration and production increased from early February levels and also noted accelerated progress on wind generation and some other energy projects. Meanwhile, firm prices and strong demand for minerals spurred production. Minneapolis noted iron ore mines continue to produce at capacity.    Labor Markets  Most districts indicated that hiring increased moderately. Chicago and San Francisco also noted that more firms plan to hire later in the year. In the Dallas district, jobs increased for production workers in high tech, apparel and lumber manufacturing.  A New York employment agency, specializing in office jobs, reported that the labor market has continued to strengthen in March and early April, with improvement described as moderate but broad-based. Meanwhile, reports of hiring remained mixed in Atlanta, but declines in some of the weaker sectors abated. Hiring increased for temporary workers in several districts.   Wages and Prices   District reports show that increases in wages and salaries were modest; however, significant increases in the cost of health benefits were noted. In the Boston district, wages for retail positions were mostly steady, although some retailers were implementing increases of 3 to 4 percent. Salaries were relatively flat in the New York district. Overall wage increases were modest in the Minneapolis district, while health benefits remained a key issue in contract disputes. Dallas and Kansas City reported that wage increases were modest, but several employers noted that high benefit costs continued to discourage them from hiring new employees. San Francisco reported that employers have responded to the rising cost of health benefits in part by shifting some of the burden to workers.    Consumer price increases were generally modest, while district reports noted significant price increases in energy and several manufacturing and construction inputs. Kansas City indicated that most retailers described selling prices as flat and expected little change in prices going forward. Chicago and New York indicated that discounted or slowly declining retail prices were beginning to level off. Meanwhile, retailers in the Dallas district said they were beginning to have some pricing authority. Significant price increases mentioned in energy-related products included natural gas, oil and gasoline. In addition, significant increases in manufacturing and construction input prices included steel and other metals, plastics, cement, gypsum wallboard and lumber. Districts in which companies passed input price increases to customers included Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas and Kansas City. Retailers and manufacturers in Richmond were attempting to pass through higher input costs. Meanwhile, San Francisco indicated that the overall impact of higher production costs on final prices was limited, and contacts in St. Louis were reluctant to pass price increases to customers.   Banking and Finance  Most Federal Reserve districts reported increased lending activity. Dallas, Kansas City, New York, Richmond and St. Louis all reported increases with Philadelphia and San Francisco reporting slow increases. Atlanta and Chicago reported flat overall demand, but Chicago noted stronger activity for small business and commercial real estate loans. Mortgage activity was up in Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City and Richmond, held steady in New York, was mixed in Philadelphia and has slowed in Atlanta. Chicago, Dallas, New York and Philadelphia reported growth in consumer lending, while Cleveland reported flat activity.    Deposits were mixed and credit quality improved. Deposits were up in Kansas City and St. Louis, flat in Cleveland and Dallas and down in New York. Both Cleveland and Kansas City noted increases in liquid accounts and declines in certificates of deposit. Credit quality improved in Chicago, Cleveland and New York and was stable in Atlanta and San Francisco.    Boston reported slowly growing demand for insurance in the first quarter, especially for life insurance, and noted that more demand came from overseas than domestically. New York and Philadelphia both noted strong first quarters for securities firms.",2004-04-21
18,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and based on information collected before June 7, 2004.  This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.     Reports from the Federal Reserve Banks indicate that economy activity in April and May continued to expand across the nation. Manufacturing activity continued to rise in most districts, with several districts describing the increases as broad-based. Most Federal Reserve districts reported increased demand for services. Retail sales remained even or rose in most districts. Residential real estate markets remained strong, and a few districts noted stable or improving conditions in commercial real estate markets. Bank lending activity increased in most districts. Conditions in the agricultural sector were reported as favorable, and the demand for agricultural products remained solid. Employment activity continued to improve, with hiring increasing at a faster pace in most districts; meanwhile, wages and salaries experienced little or muted upward pressures. Many Reserve Banks reported modest increases in consumer prices, but most districts noted rising prices of inputs, especially energy-related products, building materials, and steel.   Consumer Spending  The reports on overall retail sales in most Federal Reserve districts were generally positive. Sales were strong at discount and drug stores. Apparel and accessories, office supplies, food and other consumables, home products, and summer seasonal items were strong sellers in most districts. In contrast, sales of high-end electronics and appliances and specialty and gift items were soft in most districts. Districts reporting strong sales growth include New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and San Francisco. Minneapolis, Kansas City, Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis reported slight to moderate increases in sales. Retailers in the Dallas district offered mixed reports of both strong and soft sales growth, while Cleveland reported sales about even with 2003 levels. Boston reported year-over-year increases, but noted that sales growth had slowed since the first months of this year. General retailers throughout the districts expressed cautious optimism about sales in the coming months. Retailers in the Boston, Philadelphia, Dallas, and San Francisco districts expressed concerns about the effects of increasing energy prices on sales.   Vehicle sales increased modestly in many districts and remained flat or slightly down in the others. San Francisco reported strong auto sales, attributing the continued strength to the availability of financing incentives. A number of districts noted that sales of light, fuel-efficient autos had increased; dealers in Philadelphia and San Francisco also noted that sales of trucks and sport utility vehicles had decreased because of rising gasoline prices. Minneapolis also reported strong sales, while dealers in Kansas City saw a modest increase; both districts noted that rising gasoline costs had not impeded sales of sport utility vehicles. In Dallas, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis auto sales were flat or slightly up from 2003 levels. Atlanta reported sales growth in April, although sales are still below 2003 levels. In Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco auto dealers reported inventories above desired levels.  Manufacturing and Other Business Activity     Overall manufacturing activity increased in all Federal Reserve districts in April and May. Districts noted particularly strong growth in the defense, semiconductor, food processing, paper, lumber and other building products, textiles, automotive parts, furniture, heavy and other industrial equipment, metal products, transportation equipment, packaging, and recreational equipment and parts sectors. Districts reporting declines in activity in some sectors were Boston (home goods), Philadelphia (transportation equipment and food products), Richmond (furniture), St. Louis (paper materials and textiles), and San Francisco (commercial aircraft). Boston, New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago reported intensifying cost pressures because of rising input costs, especially for steel and related products, petrochemical products, and wood products. Chicago and Cleveland reported robust demand for steel. Chicago also reported that steel producers' orders were booked for the foreseeable future and that heavier shipping volumes were leading to a surge in truck demand.   Activity in the services sector increased in most areas throughout the districts. Demand for freight transportation services increased in the Cleveland, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis districts. Rising demand for trucking services, coupled with limited capacity, led some firms to announce new hires and capital expansions. In addition, transportation firms are more readily passing on cost increases from rising fuel and healthcare coverage costs to their customers. Tourism was up in most districts, including Boston, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and San Francisco, although some contacts expressed concerns that rising fuel costs will dampen summer travel. Other services sectors reporting growth were the software and information technology, financial, insurance, healthcare, and telecommunications sectors.  Real Estate and Construction     Residential real estate activity remained robust in most districts. Home sales were exceptionally strong in the Richmond district, and Kansas City had sales in April and May that were much higher than the previous year's levels. Some areas in the San Francisco district had an increase in sales at a near-record pace. Home price appreciation was steady in Philadelphia ; however, contacts remarked that homes were taking longer to sell than earlier in the year. The New York district reported that the housing market was still strong but indicated that sales were leveling off in New York City. Single-family housing permits were up in most of the St. Louis district, as well as in the Minneapolis and New York districts. One exception was the Chicago district, where permits were down. Dallas reported a large increase in home construction, leading to a rise in inventories. Kansas City reported that the high-end market was weaker than the entry-level market, and in Chicago sales of both new and existing high-end homes softened. According to contacts in the Chicago, Dallas, and Richmond districts, ""fence-sitters"" were jumping into the market in anticipation of a rise in mortgage rates.   Commercial real estate markets were mostly slack, although a few districts noted signs of moderate improvement. Areas with continuing high vacancy rates, slow leasing activity, and low or flat rents in April and May were downtown Boston and the St. Louis and Chicago districts. One major exception was the Washington, D.C., area of the Richmond district, where leasing activity increased substantially in recent weeks. Leasing activity improved somewhat in the Philadelphia district. Contacts in Dallas were optimistic that commercial markets were recovering, particularly since industrial demand had increased slightly over the past six weeks. Contacts had a positive outlook for the near future in Atlanta and Kansas City, where vacancies are expected to decrease over the remainder of the year. Nonresidential construction activity was mixed. Although construction in Atlanta remained at low levels, the Minneapolis, St. Louis, and Cleveland districts reported some improvement.  Banking and Finance     In most Federal Reserve districts, lending activity increased. Only the St. Louis and Chicago districts reported that overall lending activity was flat. Atlanta, Cleveland, and San Francisco reported strong loan demand, while Philadelphia, New York, Kansas City, Dallas, and Richmond indicated a slight increase in loan demand. Mortgage loan demand remained strong in the San Francisco, Cleveland, Chicago, and Philadelphia districts, held steady in the St. Louis and Richmond districts, and fell in the New York district. The decline in refinancing activity reported in Philadelphia, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and Richmond districts was often linked to the rise in mortgage interest rates. Only the Cleveland district reported strong refinancing. Deposits were flat in the Kansas City district, down in the Dallas district, and up in the Cleveland district. Lending standards were generally unchanged in the St. Louis, New York, and Kansas City districts; however, the Chicago district reported some lowering of standards because of competition.   Agriculture     Agricultural conditions across the nation were generally favorable. Recent rains have brought relief from drought conditions in the Minneapolis and Kansas City districts and have improved soil moisture levels in St. Louis, parts of Richmond, and Dallas, where contacts reported the most favorable levels in five years. However, heavy rains have necessitated the replanting of some acres in the St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Chicago districts. Spring planting was progressing ahead of the average pace in several districts, and demand for agricultural products remains solid. Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco reported strong livestock prices. Dairy prices have increased in San Francisco, and Minneapolis expects record May milk prices in Wisconsin. Boosted in part by the weakened dollar, exports have increased in the Dallas and San Francisco districts. Dallas reported concerns about a possible negative impact of the preliminary World Trade Organization rulings against cotton subsidies.   Natural Resource Industries Activity in the mining and energy sectors remains strong in the Minneapolis district, where oil and natural gas exploration and production increased slightly from mid-April. In the Kansas City district the number of active oil and gas drilling rigs rose slightly from the previous survey, but the expansion was limited by rising equipment costs and shortages of labor. Nonetheless, contacts in this district anticipate further increases in drilling, given the high energy prices. Meanwhile, the Dallas district saw little change in drilling activities, and its offshore activity remained weak. Contacts in San Francisco have experienced an increased demand for crude oil and natural gas and want to expand capacity, but are dealing with constraints in obtaining raw materials. Minneapolis reported that the iron ore shipping season was well under way.   Labor Markets, Wages, and Prices     Most districts indicated strengthening of labor markets. Boston, New York, Chicago, Minneapolis, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported increasing employment, plant expansions, and plant openings across several sectors, including manufacturing, construction, freight transportation services, and healthcare services. Richmond reported soft labor demand in the retail sector but stronger demand for temporary production and distribution centers, administrative, financial, and customer service workers in recent weeks. Manufacturing employment in the district continued to expand. In Atlanta, small businesses reported rising labor demand, as did firms in the construction, services, and automotive parts manufacturing sectors; layoffs continued in the apparel and industrial chemical sectors, however. Contacts in the Dallas district reported continuing weakness in the labor market but indicated that some firms were planning to hire new employees.   District reports indicated little or muted upward pressures on wages, although the rising cost of health insurance remained a key issue. The San Francisco and Kansas City districts noted that sufficient labor availability was leading to limited wage pressures. The New York and Dallas districts reported little pressure on wages, while the Minneapolis and Boston districts saw moderate increases in wages. The New York district noted scattered reports that starting salaries were rising in some industries. In the Boston district, contacts in the retail sector expect wages to increase. Manufacturing firms kept the wage rates of new hires stable in the Cleveland district. Contacts in the San Francisco and Dallas districts noted high costs of health insurance. Contacts in the trucking and shipping sectors in the Cleveland district also expressed concerns over health insurance costs.  Consumer price increases were generally modest, but most districts reported increasing input prices, particularly of energy-related products, building materials, and steel. Retail prices in the Boston, Philadelphia, and San Francisco districts remained generally stable and increased modestly in the Kansas City and Dallas district. Merchandise is being marked down less in the Cleveland district. Meanwhile, merchants have seen increases in vendor prices in the Cleveland and Philadelphia districts. In response to higher input prices, some businesses were able to push up prices to their end consumers in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas districts.",2004-06-16
19,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and based on information collected before July 19, 2004.  This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.     Federal Reserve districts reported that economic activity continued to expand     in June and early July, although several districts reported that the rate of     growth moderated. The Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis,     and Dallas Districts characterized growth rates as ranging from modest (Minneapolis)     to solid (Chicago), while New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Kansas City, and San     Francisco noted that growth rates slowed somewhat in their districts. Boston     cited mixed reports from its business contacts. Reports of rising prices at     the producer level continued to be common, though increases in retail prices     were only infrequently reported. While wage gains remained generally flat, benefits     costs continued to rise.   Retail sales were widely cited as having slowed; in particular, most districts     reported that auto sales were flat to down. Manufacturing activity increased     across the country, though there were pockets of weakness and gains were generally     more measured than in the early spring. Travel and tourism were reported to     be strong in many districts. Regarding construction, the pattern of past reports     continued, as residential construction was still strong across most districts,     while nonresidential building remained generally weak. In the banking sector,     borrowing by commercial clients rose moderately in most districts. In the consumer     lending category, mortgage originations were reported to be robust, but refinancings     fell further. Agricultural conditions across the country were mixed, as some     areas suffered from unusually wet weather. Mining and energy enterprises saw     increases in activity in recent weeks.   Cost pressures were cited for a variety of production inputs in most districts.     Energy, steel, and cement prices were widely cited as high and were reported     to have moved higher in most districts. Some agricultural product prices, including     beef, chicken, and milk, were also cited as adding to pricing pressures. The     degree to which businesses have been able to pass along these prices continued     to vary, but no district reported an acceleration in general retail prices.     The few reports of labor shortages were narrow in scope. Wage increases were     also widely reported to be moderate. However, businesses continued to cite health     care costs as a factor in significantly boosting total labor costs.   Consumer Spending     Consumer spending moderated across much of the country in June and early July,     following strong increases in spending in the early spring. Seven districts     reported that consumer spending had softened since their last reports: New York,     Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco. In the     New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland Districts, much of the moderation in spending     was attributed to weather that was cooler than typical for the time of year.   Kansas City reported that spending had stayed largely flat in recent weeks,     while Richmond reported that spending remained flat or was lower. Boston characterized     consumer spending in its district as mixed. The districts reporting increases     in spending were St. Louis and Minneapolis. St. Louis indicated that consumer     spending was strong, whereas Minneapolis characterized spending as showing modest     increases. A few districts noted that there were some indications of increases     in spending in early July.   Auto sales were generally weak throughout the country in the late spring. Compared     with sales in previous months, auto sales in June were characterized as flat     or falling by the Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas     City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Among the districts that commented     on automobile sales, only St. Louis indicated that auto sales rose in recent     months.   Home furnishings and home improvement items sold well in the Boston, Chicago,     and Kansas City Districts, but New York noted that these products sold less     well in its district than they had previously. Apparel sold poorly in the Philadelphia,     Richmond, and Chicago Districts, but the Dallas District reported that sales     of women's apparel was strong. The environment for travel and tourism was reported     to be improving in the New York, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco     Districts, but mixed in the Richmond, Chicago, and Minneapolis Districts.   Manufacturing and Other Business Activity     Manufacturing firms across the county continued to report increases in production,     continuing the pattern of strong production gains seen throughout the earlier     part of 2004. All districts reported increases in production in June and early     July, though the Richmond, Cleveland, and San Francisco Districts reported that     the pace of increases slowed somewhat. By contrast, Chicago and Kansas City     reported robust activity in their districts, and steel production continued     to be brisk throughout the Midwest. Philadelphia, Chicago, and Kansas City also     reported that firms' expansion of their capital stock continued at a moderate     pace; Boston, by contrast, reported that firms in its district do not plan to     add additional capital this year beyond already-budgeted increases.   Reports of scattered shortages and longer lead times are an indication of the     strength of demand for manufactured items. For instance, significantly longer     lead times for many industrial inputs were reported in the Philadelphia and     Richmond Districts. Contacts in the Chicago and St. Louis Districts saw shortages     of cement; these shortages had been confined to the East and West Coasts in     the past. The Cleveland and Chicago Districts noted that shortages of scrap     steel continued to constrain production at some of their facilities.   Transportation-related issues were reported in several districts as well. St.     Louis and Kansas City reported delays in coal shipments due to crowded railroad     lines; contacts in the Dallas District also expressed concerns about congested     railroad lines. And Boston noted that declines in trucking capacity had resulted     in rising shipping prices. Transportation and shipping services were in high     demand across the country, with Philadelphia, Richmond, Cleveland, Atlanta,     Dallas, and San Francisco reporting strong increases in activity in recent months     for the shipping firms in their districts.   Both the Cleveland and Chicago Districts indicated that production at their     auto assembly plants was below the levels of this time last year. St Louis reported     that an auto manufacturer in its district will idle some of its plants in order     to reduce inventories.   Construction and Real Estate     Most districts reported that new home sales stayed strong through the end of     June. The Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas,     and San Francisco Districts all reported rising new home sales in recent weeks.     Reports from New York, Cleveland, and Richmond indicated that new home sales     slowed in these districts but remained at high levels. Boston reported that     higher-priced homes remained on the market longer in its district than they     typically have. Cleveland and Minneapolis reported that sales in the lower-price     parts of their markets slowed in May and June, though Kansas City reported that     this was the strongest-selling market segment in its district.   Commercial construction continued to be weak throughout the country. St. Louis,     an exception, said that commercial construction showed some improvement in most     of its district. Commercial building in the Kansas City and Chicago Districts     was characterized as flat, while activity in Minneapolis's district appeared     mixed.   Banking and Finance     Most districts reported increases in borrowing in recent months. Commercial     lending improved through the end of June, with the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland,     Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts     reporting rising commercial borrowing in recent weeks. New York, Philadelphia,     and Atlanta, however, noted that the increases in their districts were modest.     In the Chicago District, commercial borrowing was characterized as flat.   In general, consumer borrowing also rose recently, but seemingly more moderately     than commercial borrowing. Within the consumer borrowing category, five districts     reported increases in their banks' residential real estate lending: Philadelphia,     Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis. Several of these districts indicated     that although overall residential real estate lending had risen, the volume     of refinancings fell further recently. Both the New York and San Francisco Districts     saw borrowing by homebuyers decline, but San Francisco noted that the levels     of residential real estate lending in its district remained high.   Natural Resources and Agriculture     Assessments of the agricultural sector varied according to weather conditions,     but demand kept prices high for a variety of products. Cool or wet weather hindered     crop growth in the Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts.     Outcomes were reported to be mixed by the Richmond District, as thunderstorms     alleviated drought conditions but also caused wind damage. Favorable conditions     were noted by Dallas and San Francisco. Cleveland noted that agricultural prices     (beef, chicken, and milk) continued to rise for its food processors, while San     Francisco noted high prices for beef cattle and other livestock, milk, berries,     grapes, and nuts.   Activity in extractive industries remains at a high level. Minneapolis, Kansas     City, and Dallas reported higher levels of activity at oil and gas drilling     rigs. Minneapolis and Kansas City noted that equipment shortages (and labor     as well in the case of Kansas City) were holding back exploration activities.     Dallas cited a lack of domestic prospects as limiting drilling activity and     noted that oil-field service companies reported excess capacity. Minneapolis     also reported that mining activities in its district have been very strong.   Labor Markets, Wages and Prices     Most districts reported strengthening labor market conditions. Employment agencies     reported rising demand for labor in the New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta,     Chicago, and Minneapolis Districts. Reports from other employers were more varied,     but still positive, in most districts. The weakest employment reports were from     Boston, Cleveland, and Dallas, where reports of employment gains were either     mixed (some industries up, some industries down) or relatively rare. Limited     occupational shortages were reported in Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City,     and San Francisco. San Francisco reported the broadest areas of shortage: ""skilled     occupations in a number of industries, including construction, manufacturing,     financial services, and technology services."" Overall, however, districts reported     only modest wage increases. Boston and San Francisco reported that rising health     care costs are a continuing concern for businesses.   A wide variety of material input costs were cited as high and steady or rising     by several districts, yet retail price inflation was typically reported to be     moderate. All districts reported some form of higher input costs, but the degree     to which these costs could be passed on varied by industry and district. Typical     reports from manufacturers suggested that they have been unable to charge higher     prices to fully offset increases in their input prices. For example Chicago     reported, ""While more manufacturers reportedly were adding surcharges to at     least partially cover these higher costs, many others still said that competition     prevented them from passing any cost increases on to their customers."" The Cleveland,     Atlanta, and Chicago Districts all reported material cost pressures in the construction     sector. Atlanta reported that strong demand conditions had made it easier to     pass on these higher costs, but Cleveland and Chicago reported that contacts     had less success passing on cost increases in construction.",2004-07-28
20,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco based on information collected before September 1, 2004.  This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve System and is not a representation of the views of Federal Reserve officials.     Reports from the Federal Reserve Banks indicated that economic activity continued to expand in late July and August, although several districts indicated that the pace had slowed since their last reports.  Districts' characterizations of the rate of expansion ranged from slow (St. Louis) to solid (San Francisco), with many districts reporting modest or moderate growth. Household spending was reported to have softened in many parts of the nation, reflecting lackluster retail sales and some cooling in new and existing home sales.  Conditions in the manufacturing sector, on the other hand, improved further nationwide, especially among capital equipment and other durable goods makers.  Residential construction activity remained at high levels but slowed a bit in some regions; nonresidential construction remained tepid, as did demand for commercial and industrial space.  Agricultural conditions were mixed and generally tied to the weather.  Demand for consumer loans softened somewhat, but several districts noted increased commercial lending.  Employers in most districts continued to expand payrolls, though districts reported some unevenness across sectors.  While persistently rapid increases in nonwage labor costs continued to be a concern for many employers, wage pressures remained modest.  Consumer prices were generally flat or up modestly, although there were noticeable price increases for energy and some material inputs. Consumer Spending Consumer spending was mixed across districts and across products in late July and August, with the pace of spending slowing on balance relative to the previous survey period.  Retail sales were described as solid in San Francisco, mixed in Dallas, and softer in New York, Richmond, and Chicago.  Despite the recent slowing in retail sales, several Reserve Banks noted that sales were still up on a year-over-year basis.  By category, a few districts singled out computers and other electronics and women's accessories and jewelry as being in particularly strong demand.  Sales of back-to-school items, especially children's apparel, reportedly were disappointing for retailers in New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis.  By contrast, Kansas City indicated that sales of these items were up solidly from previous years, and Philadelphia noted that they were in line with merchants' expectations. With respect to autos, sluggish sales, high inventories, or both were noted by contacts in Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas.  St. Louis, San Francisco, and Kansas City, on the other hand, reported improvement in motor vehicle sales.  In terms of composition, Kansas City and Dallas indicated that SUVs and light trucks did not sell as well as smaller vehicles, though the opposite was true in Atlanta and Chicago. Business conditions in the travel and tourism sector were reported to be strong on balance in the districts of San Francisco, Kansas City, Atlanta, and New York, and in some areas of the Minneapolis and Boston Districts.  Rainy weather in the Northeast and unusually cool weather in northern Minnesota damped travel to those areas.  Hurricane Charley and Tropical Storm Gaston deterred travel and tourism to some coastal areas in the Richmond District.  The Atlanta District noted that most central Florida tourist attractions closed for only one day because of the hurricane, and damage to the theme parks was limited. Manufacturing and Other Business Activity Total manufacturing activity increased throughout the country.  Districts noted that manufacturers of durable goods, including many types of capital equipment, showed the largest increases.  Specifically, strong demand was reported for aerospace products (Boston, Atlanta, and San Francisco), steel products (St. Louis), industrial machinery (Richmond and Chicago), and IT products (Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco).  In addition, Philadelphia noted increased demand for instruments and electrical equipment.  The few indications of weakness in selected manufacturing sectors came from the St. Louis District, which reported that firms in home fixtures, furniture, and electronic cable manufacturing anticipate plant closings, and the Cleveland District, where nondurables manufacturers noted high inventories of finished-goods and flat to falling capacity utilization.  Reduced demand for transportation equipment in the Philadelphia District and for apparel in the Richmond and Atlanta Districts also was reported. The generally robust activity in manufacturing boosted demand for transportation services in many districts.  Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City reported strong demand for overland shipping services, which resulted in bottlenecks in freight movement in some areas.  According to the San Francisco District, high volumes of international trade kept several West Coast seaports operating at capacity, which also led to increased demand for rail services.  Similarly, New York noted that volume through the Port of New York and New Jersey rose substantially in July and August. Regarding other services, activity during the survey period was mixed.  St. Louis and San Francisco noted improvement in demand for health-care services; San Francisco also reported improved demand for the services of advertising and media firms.  In contrast, in the Richmond District, service firms reported generally weaker customer demand, and the New York District cited a contact who reported weakened demand in the securities industry.  Boston noted deceleration in demand for software and IT services in late July and August, despite increased demand for IT hardware. Real Estate and Construction Home price appreciation, home sales, and residential construction activity remained at high levels in most districts, although there were numerous reports of slight cooling in market activity.  Signs of moderation in the pace of home price appreciation and/or sales were reported by New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco.  The Dallas report described housing markets in Texas as ""lively,"" but noted little increase in median home prices this year. Commercial real estate markets were little changed from the last survey period.  Most districts reported stable but high vacancies and steady but low rents.  That said, there were, scattered reports of improvement.  The New York District reported that the office market in Manhattan strengthened further in July and the Richmond District noted commercial leasing activity increased in the Washington, D.C., area.  Also, the St. Louis District indicated slow improvement in commercial and industrial real estate markets. Agriculture and Natural Resources Agricultural output and conditions in late July and August varied across the nation, with weather, as usual, playing the key role.  Cooler-than-normal weather in many parts of the country, most notably the agricultural regions of the St. Louis, Chicago, Kansas City, and Minneapolis Districts, slowed crop development.  The Dallas, Atlanta, and Richmond Districts noted that excessive rainfall hampered crop development.  The Atlanta and Richmond Districts bore the brunt of Hurricane Charley, though its damage to crops reportedly was limited to coastal areas.  Atlanta reported that the USDA estimated that Hurricane Charley ruined around 20 percent of this year's citrus harvest, including about 10 percent of the orange crop. Higher energy prices continued to encourage oil and gas extraction.  Kansas City reported that the count of active oil and gas drilling rigs in the region increased slightly from the previous survey period and was up strongly from a year ago.  Oil drilling activity also was reported to have increased in the Dallas District. Financial Services and Credit Loan demand improved on net in many districts in recent weeks, as an uptick     in demand for commercial loans offset some softening in consumer loan demand.     Credit quality for both loan types was steady to slightly improved. Reports     indicate that demand for commercial and industrial loans increased in the New     York, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts. Commercial     lending was flat in Philadelphia, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas. Respondents     in two of the districts where commercial lending was flat--Chicago and Kansas     City--indicated that loan demand from businesses was restrained to some extent     by the use of internal financing, as the cash flow of many businesses improved. On the consumer side, loan demand moderated somewhat in several districts, largely due to a falloff in mortgage lending.  Some districts reported continued moderate increases in consumer loans, but several noted softening demand for home purchase and refinance loans.  In characterizing home loan demand, the Chicago and Kansas City Districts indicated slight increases, and Richmond reported moderate increases.  Cleveland, New York, Dallas, and San Francisco all noted softening in demand for home loans, while Philadelphia described demand for such loans as mixed. Labor Markets, Wages, and Prices Reports from most districts suggest continued gains in jobs during the recent survey period, although with some uneveness across sectors and regions.  Several districts noted a pickup in demand for temporary service workers, including those in manufacturing, and one district (Atlanta) reported an increase in the rate of conversion of temporary workers to permanent hires.  District reports also mentioned increased hiring in the energy, transportation services, durable goods manufacturing, and health-care sectors.  The Cleveland and San Francisco Districts reported a pickup in labor demand among banks.  Hiring reportedly was more subdued among producers of nondurable goods and selected services firms.  In some cases, job losses were recorded:  apparel manufacturers continued to shed jobs in the Atlanta District, and some financial and educational services providers scaled back employment in the St. Louis District. Wage increases remained modest overall, although there were reports of upward wage pressures for selected occupations and industries.  Reports indicated that wage pressures were building for skilled workers, and remaining flat for other types of workers.  District reports continued to note concerns among businesses about the rising cost of health care and other employee benefits. The reports indicated that consumer prices were generally flat or up modestly in late July and August, although they continued to cite noticeable price increases for oil, natural gas, steel, lumber, cement, concrete, and other building materials.  This characterization of price developments was widespread across the districts.  In addition, Cleveland and Dallas noted price increases for processed foods, and Chicago indicated that higher oil prices have driven up the cost of plastics, rubber, and other petroleum-based materials.  Despite the high oil prices, however, two districts (Minneapolis and Dallas) reported that gasoline prices had increased only moderately if at all.  In this regard, refiners in the Dallas District reported that the steep rise in crude oil prices relative to gasoline has squeezed margins.",2004-09-08
21,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago based on information collected before October 18, 2004. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.     Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts generally indicated that economic activity continued to expand in September and early October. Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City noted continued expansion in economic activity. Richmond and Dallas said the pace had quickened, while New York, Cleveland, and San Francisco suggested that growth had moderated somewhat. St. Louis received mixed reports on economic activity, and Atlanta cited widespread hurricane-related disruptions. Many reports suggested that higher energy costs were constraining consumer and business spending. Reports on consumer spending in September and early October were mixed by District and spending category. In contrast, business outlays appeared to pick up in most regions, with modest increases in both capital spending and hiring. Residential real estate activity remained robust in most Districts, although it slowed in some. Nonresidential activity was still relatively weak across the nation, though there were scattered signs of improvement. Manufacturing activity increased further since the last Beige Book. Household loan demand seemed to soften somewhat, but business loan demand picked up. Businesses in most Districts continued to express concern over the rising costs of energy and other inputs, although more manufacturers and business service providers were reportedly able to pass part--if not all--of these cost increases along to their customers. However, increases in wages and retail prices generally were subdued. Fall harvests were ahead of the normal pace, and yields of corn and soybeans were expected to set records in some Districts. Energy-related activities continued to increase, despite some disruptions caused by Hurricane Ivan. Consumer spending/tourism Consumer spending in September and early October was mixed by region and category. Many Districts indicated that retail sales were soft during the reporting period, while others noted modest improvement. Apparel sales were mixed across the nation. Unseasonably warm temperatures were blamed for weak sales of fall merchandise in the Cleveland, Chicago, and Minneapolis Districts. Hurricanes disrupted retail activity in the Atlanta District, though they did provide a boost to sales of building materials. Most retailers appeared content with inventory levels heading into the holiday shopping season. Light vehicle sales were strong in many Districts during September, although they dropped off in early October. Boston, New York, and San Francisco reported strong tourism activity, but Atlanta said that tourism ""took a substantial hit because of the hurricanes."" Contacts in many Districts said that high energy costs were constraining household spending, and some said the presidential election was heightening uncertainty among consumers. Business spending/hiring On balance, capital spending appeared to pick up modestly. Philadelphia, Chicago, and Kansas City reported that manufacturing firms increased their capital outlays, while Cleveland and St. Louis said that spending was mixed by industry segment. Chicago added that special factors, such as expiring tax incentives and changing environmental regulations, contributed to higher capital outlays. Several Districts reported strong demand for transportation services, and shipping companies were said to be purchasing equipment to keep up with rising freight volumes. With regard to other business spending, Philadelphia noted an increase in technology spending while Chicago and San Francisco reported gains in advertising. Hiring activity varied by region and industry, but appeared to increase modestly. Nearly half of the Districts said that demand for temporary help increased since the last Beige Book, although momentum slowed in some areas. Reports of permanent hiring became more frequent, notably in manufacturing industries. Five District reports suggested a general increase in manufacturing jobs, while none indicated an outright decline. Boston noted some ""sizable increases"" in retail employment, and Richmond said that a broad array of service-producing firms were adding workers. Hiring reportedly improved in financial services (New York and Minneapolis) and transportation (Dallas) as well. Some Districts continued to report isolated shortages of workers in particular occupations such as skilled manufacturing (Boston, Chicago), truck drivers (Cleveland), and upper-level finance occupations (Minneapolis). In addition, some Districts noted signs of more broad-based firming of labor markets. New York said ""there are fewer people seeking (office worker) positions;"" contacts in the Richmond District suggested there were ""fewer qualified candidates to fill permanent positions;"" Chicago noted there were ""fewer applications for open positions;"" and Minneapolis indicated that ""labor markets have tightened for a number of industries."" Construction/real estate Residential construction and real estate activity was robust again in September, although it appeared to soften further from the last Beige Book. New York was the only District to report a general increase in housing market activity. Boston and Kansas City said that sales of high-end homes had softened, and Cleveland reported weakness at all price points. Home prices continued to increase at a healthy pace in most areas. However, a Realtor in Minneapolis suggested some slight price reductions, and homebuilders in the Cleveland and Dallas Districts reportedly raised incentives and/or lowered prices to spur demand. On balance, nonresidential activity remained weak in most Districts, but there were scattered signs of improvement. Chicago and Dallas noted some pickup in office markets, and Cleveland reported particular strength in the light industrial segment. The Richmond and Chicago Districts said that retail real estate activity remained robust. Manufacturing District reports suggested that manufacturing activity expanded further from the previous Beige Book. Reports ranged from solid expansion in the Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts to decidedly mixed in St. Louis. Hurricanes caused some production disruptions in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts. Stronger activity was evident across a wide array of industry segments, though, on balance, producers of durable goods exhibited more strength than producers of nondurable goods. A number of Districts reported continued strength in metals production, Richmond and Dallas noted improvements in petroleum-based products (such as plastics and petrochemicals), and Chicago said that demand for heavy equipment was still very strong. Demand for high-tech goods was mixed. Boston and San Francisco noted some softening in their semiconductor industries, but Dallas said that strong orders for consumer electronics helped boost demand for semiconductors. The September surge in light vehicle sales helped bring bloated inventories down to more desirable levels. Still, Cleveland pointed out that domestic automakers had announced production cuts. Banking/finance Loan demand followed a pattern similar to that reported in the last Beige Book; the household sector softened a bit while loan demand from businesses strengthened somewhat. The moderation on the household side largely reflected a decline in mortgage applications. While new originations were holding up in most Districts, refinancing activity fell off. There were no changes reported in standards and terms for household loans, and credit quality continued to improve. Many Districts indicated that business borrowing had increased; New York was the only District to note a slowdown in business lending and tighter standards on business loans. In general, business loan quality remained high and even improved in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts. Prices/employment costs Wage pressures generally remained stable, according to most District reports. Contacts in the Chicago District, however, said that wages continued to trend higher and, for the first time in several years, some firms had begun paying hiring and retention bonuses again. In addition, there were scattered reports of wage increases in occupations where workers were in particularly short supply, such as truck drivers and skilled tradespeople. Kansas City noted that firms in energy drilling activities had raised wages 10 percent or more to attract entry-level workers. Contacts in much of the nation continued to express concern about high benefits costs, most notably for health insurance. Firms across the nation also expressed concern about higher input costs, particularly for energy and petroleum-based products, metals, and construction materials. Three broad industry categories were disproportionately affected by these increases: transportation, manufacturing, and construction. Six of the twelve District reports suggested that trucking firms were able to pass along most, if not all, of the cost increases to their customers. In contrast, Atlanta said that trucking firms were having a more difficult time increasing rates, and Chicago and Dallas indicated that competitive pressures were preventing airlines from passing along higher jet fuel costs. Manufacturers said that prices remained elevated for some other inputs, such as metals and plastics. While some Districts said that manufacturing firms had little success in passing along higher materials costs, one-third noted that more of their producers' customers were accepting price increases. Prices continued to rise for building materials in short supply, such as metals, concrete, and lumber. Here again, many builders had to absorb the higher input costs, but builders in the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts were able to pass along at least some of these increases to homebuyers. Despite mounting cost pressures, most District reports suggested that retail price increases were still largely subdued. Boston was the only District to indicate that retailers were able to raise prices to the consumer in response to higher costs. Agriculture/natural resources Fall harvests were ahead of the normal pace in much of the country, as growing conditions improved in September and early October. Corn and soybean yields were expected to set records in some Districts. With lower current prices for corn and soybeans, more producers planned to store crops in hope of higher prices in the future. There were reports of storage and transportation constraints for corn. A record cotton harvest was expected in Texas, but both cotton and citrus crops in the Southeast experienced significant damage as a result of the hurricanes. Demand for livestock remained strong. Moreover, Kansas City and Dallas reported that pasture conditions had improved, and ranchers in the Dallas District suggested these conditions were ""conducive for herd expansion."" Activity in the energy industry continued to increase, despite some disruptions in the Gulf of Mexico resulting from Hurricane Ivan. Minneapolis, Kansas City, and, to a lesser extent, Dallas reported increased drilling for oil and natural gas.",2004-10-27
22,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and based   on information collected before November 22, 2004. This document summarizes comments   received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is   not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.   Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts generally paint a picture     of continued economic growth from mid-October to mid-November, with a number     of areas improving. Eleven Districts reported expanding economic activity, with     New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Dallas noting a pickup in the pace of expansion     since their last reports. Minneapolis indicated that the expansion in that District     was broad-based, and San Francisco described the region's activity as solid.     The Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts saw moderate gains in economic     activity while St. Louis viewed the gains there as modest. Only the Cleveland     District reported little change in economic activity.  Overall consumer spending was uneven since the last Beige Book, with only a     few Districts reporting stronger retail sales and many noting mixed, flat or     slower sales. Automobile sales were flat to down across most Districts, and     several Districts reported higher dealer inventories than desired. In contrast,     manufacturing and service sector activity increased across the country. Residential     real estate activity generally remained at high levels, but continued to show     signs of cooling in a number of Districts. Nonresidential activity, while still     sluggish in many areas, appeared to be turning the corner in several Districts.     In credit markets, business lending was strengthening, but the pace of consumer     and mortgage lending was mixed across the country. Contacts in the securities     industry reported increased inflows into stock mutual funds and noted a pickup     of stock issuance and merger-related activity. Many agricultural producers across     the country said they were looking forward to large or record crop production.     Energy-related activities remained strong.  Consumer Spending    Consumer spending was uneven from mid-October to mid-November. Retail sales     increased in the Atlanta, Kansas City, Minneapolis and Philadelphia Districts     and were ""solid"" in the San Francisco District. Sales were mixed in the Boston     and Dallas Districts but were sluggish or lower in the Chicago, New York, Richmond,     and St. Louis Districts. Retailers in the Dallas, Kansas City and New York Districts     reported that demand for premium merchandise has been noticeably stronger than     that for lower-priced lines, with some contacts suggesting that lower-income     households might have been more greatly affected by high energy prices. Inventories     appear to be in line with sales, with only the Boston District reporting that     retail inventory levels were up slightly.  Automobile sales were flat to down across most Districts. The Chicago, Cleveland,     Dallas, Kansas City and San Francisco Districts reported that dealer inventories     were higher than desired.  Manufacturing    Manufacturing activity increased across the country. Nine Districts reported     a pickup in production, with only the Cleveland, Richmond, and San Francisco     Districts noting that activity was unchanged or expanding more slowly than was     reported in the last Beige Book. Overseas competition continued to weigh on     several industries, but a number of reports noted increased capital investment     and hiring. Manufacturers remained concerned about high energy prices and rising     prices for other inputs.  Orders were strongest for chemicals, food, and products to supply the aerospace,     agriculture, energy, medical, defense and construction industries. Both the     Chicago and San Francisco Districts noted a pickup in bookings for machine tools.     The Chicago and Cleveland Districts reported some slowing in domestic steel     production, in part because of imports. Furniture production weakened in the     Boston, Philadelphia, and St. Louis Districts, but turned up in the Richmond     District. Richmond also reported that the textile business was unseasonably     slow, but demand for apparel and textile products was reported as ""robust"" in     the San Francisco District and up from three months ago in the Dallas District.  Transportation manufacturing was mixed. The Chicago District reported new     orders for heavy trucks were ""at extremely strong levels,"" with production constrained     by shortages of engines and other parts. Slowing demand for automobiles and     auto parts were seen in the Chicago, Cleveland, Philadelphia and St. Louis Districts.     At the same time, the Atlanta District reported a recent announcement of additional     auto parts manufacturing plants.  Conditions in the high-tech sector also were mixed. The Boston District reported     a considerable softening of orders for semiconductors and related equipment     in the third quarter. In the San Francisco District, sales and orders were unchanged     for semiconductors and other high-tech products, which led to rising chip inventories     and a slight drop in capacity utilization. In contrast, the Dallas District     noted continued growth in production and orders for high-tech products.  Services    Service sector activity was strong or increasing among the Districts reporting     on that sector. Tourism activity was slightly improved across much of the nation.     Demand for workers at temporary employment agencies picked up in the Boston,     Chicago, Dallas, Richmond and New York Districts. Shortages of temporary workers     were reported in the Boston and New York Districts, and the Boston, Chicago,     and Dallas Districts reported an increase in the number of temporary workers     obtaining more permanent positions. Business activity sped up at software and     information technology services firms in the Boston District, while demand for     legal and accounting services was reported as strong in the Dallas District.    Demand for transportation services was reported as robust. Shipping firms in     the Cleveland and Richmond Districts increased rates to offset higher fuel costs.     Seaports in the San Francisco District continued to handle very high volumes,     with delays developing at some ports. Prices for ground and sea transport were     rising in response to bottlenecks.  Construction and Real Estate    Residential real estate activity was still robust in late October and early     November, although some signs of cooling were noted by the Atlanta, Chicago,     Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City, Richmond and San Francisco Districts.  Commercial real estate markets remained weak, with high vacancies and low--even     falling--rents. Nevertheless, several Districts noted that levels of excess     capacity continued to ebb. Districts reported that nonresidential construction     continues to be at low levels. However, leasing activity was up in the Dallas     and Richmond Districts. The Atlanta and Minneapolis Districts noted lower commercial     vacancy rates, and San Francisco District contacts indicated that office and     industrial vacancy rates were edging down. In contrast, the New York District     reported weakening in commercial markets, where strong leasing activity was     outpaced by an increased availability of space.  Banking and Finance    Overall lending activity was mixed, and credit quality remained good across     the nation in the past few weeks. Business lending firmed in a number of areas,     but residential mortgage lending and refinancing activity softened further.     Lending overall increased in the Philadelphia and Richmond Districts, slowed     slightly in the New York District, and was ""well below expectations"" in the     Chicago District. The Kansas City and San Francisco Districts reported little     change in loan demand, with the latter District noting that loan demand was     ""solid."" Deposit growth picked up in the Cleveland, Dallas and New York Districts,     with no reports of changes elsewhere.  Demand for commercial loans strengthened in many Districts, but the Atlanta     District noted that commercial loan demand remained at low levels overall.  Reports on consumer lending were more mixed. Chicago and Philadelphia District     bankers said demand increased slightly for household loans, with notable gains     in home equity lending in the Philadelphia District. Consumer loan demand continued     to be strong in the Atlanta District, and was ""steady"" in the Cleveland District.     On the other hand, lending declined in the Kansas City and New York Districts.    Residential lending was also uneven across the country. Demand for mortgages     slowed in the Dallas, New York, and San Francisco Districts, but picked up in     the Chicago and Philadelphia Districts while remaining flat in the Kansas City     and Richmond Districts. Refinancing activity slowed in the New York, Philadelphia,     and San Francisco Districts and remained light in the Richmond District.  Overall credit quality remained unchanged or improved. Credit quality improved     in the Chicago District, and continued to be good in the Atlanta, Cleveland,     Philadelphia and San Francisco Districts. The Kansas City, New York and Richmond     Districts reported little or no change in credit and/or lending standards.  The New York and Philadelphia Districts reported a noticeable pickup in the     securities industry since the last Beige Book report. In the Philadelphia District,     investment companies and stockbrokers have received strong cash inflows, and     some securities firms are raising staffing levels. The New York District saw     increased inflows into equity mutual funds, and the investment banking community     reported a pickup in stock issuance and especially in merger and acquisition     activity.  Agriculture and Natural Resources    Recent wet weather delayed field work in many areas, but large or record crop     production is anticipated by farmers across much of the country. Above-average     quality and yields, especially for corn and soybeans, were reported by producers     in the Richmond and Chicago Districts as well as in the Kansas City District,     where agricultural lenders anticipate farm income to set record highs this year.     The Minneapolis and St. Louis Districts also reported favorable yield and production     estimates. A record cotton crop is anticipated in the Dallas District, and estimates     of cotton production were revised up in the Atlanta District. The hurricanes     seriously affected production of several Florida crops.  In the Chicago District, livestock producers were benefiting from lower feed     costs. The Dallas District reported strong demand for calves and feeder cattle.     Ranchers in the Kansas City District remained reluctant to expand herds.  Energy activity remained strong, but the pace of growth was mixed. Oil field     activity was up in the Minneapolis and Dallas Districts and at full capacity     in the San Francisco District, but the Kansas City District reported a slight     easing since the previous survey. Several oil and gas pipelines in the Gulf     of Mexico remained off-line because of storm damage.  In the Kansas City District, ""About half of the contacts continue to report     constraints on drilling due to labor and equipment shortages. Absent these constraints--which     are expected to persist for at least another six months--contacts believe drilling     could increase by 10 to 20 percent."" The Dallas District noted potential for     continued expansion in oilfield equipment manufacturing, oilfield construction,     shallow offshore drilling and some oilfield services, but also saw shortages     of steel products in the oil patch.  Iron ore mines in the Minneapolis District were producing at capacity, with     capital expansion under way. In addition, other mining companies were expanding     and investing in capital equipment in Montana.  Prices    Increased cost pressures were reported by firms across the country, particularly     for energy, transportation, food and petroleum-based products. While competition     limited the ability of producers to pass higher costs forward, several Districts     noted that some industries were successful in passing along cost increases.     For example, the Chicago District reported that an increasing number of firms     were able to pass higher input costs along to their business customers. The     Boston District reported that customers had become more tolerant of price increases     that were attributable to rising materials and energy costs.  Retailers have been less successful passing along cost increases than manufacturers,     with most Districts reporting little change in retail prices. Contacts in the     Boston and Chicago Districts posted some price increases at restaurants to offset     higher food costs. Automobile dealers in several Districts have increased their     use of rebates, promotions and sometimes substantial incentives. Makers of IT     products in the San Francisco District reported additional price declines for     some of their goods and services, including an acceleration of price declines     for some types of semiconductors.  Continued cost increases for some building materials were reported in the Atlanta,     Cleveland, Kansas City, Minneapolis, New York, Richmond and San Francisco Districts.     Cement has been in short supply, and prices have risen for both concrete and     cement. Steel prices also rose. While construction-related steel shortages eased     in the Chicago and San Francisco Districts, there were reports of shortages     of specialty steel in several Districts.  A slight cooling in the pace of home sales dampened home price increases in     some markets. Home prices in the Dallas District softened further since the     last Beige Book. The New York District reported that while housing demand remained     strong, prices had leveled off in parts of New Jersey. A slight slowdown in     home sales led to some moderation in home price appreciation in the San Francisco     District. Home prices were up slightly in the Kansas City District and continued     to rise at a steady pace in the Philadelphia District.  Solid U.S. production pushed down prices for corn, soybeans and cotton, but     significant crop damage in Florida pushed up prices for tomatoes, peppers and     other key Florida crops. Contacts in the Chicago District were concerned that     higher fuel and fertilizer costs would partly offset gains in farm income.  Labor Markets    Labor markets continued to improve over the past few weeks, with numerous reports     of hiring. The Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, Minneapolis and New York Districts     reported increased hiring or improved labor markets. Contacts in several Districts     noted difficulty finding workers for specific occupations, such as accounting,     construction and skilled professionals in the energy industry.  There continued to be little wage pressure in most Districts, although a few     Districts noted that higher benefit costs are pushing up total compensation.     Only the Chicago District reported that overall wages increased at a slightly     faster pace. Temporary employment firms in the Boston and Dallas Districts expressed     concerns about cost increases, particularly for medical, worker's compensation     and state unemployment insurance, and said they were attempting to pass these     cost increases on to customers.",2004-12-01
23,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and based on information collected before January 10, 2005. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.   Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve districts indicated that economic activity     continued to expand from late November through early January. Eleven districts     characterized activity as expanding with Atlanta, New York, and Richmond noting     that the pace of activity had quickened since their last reports. The Cleveland     District was less upbeat, characterizing economic activity in that district     as mixed.  Consumer spending was generally higher since the last Beige Book and a number     of districts reported that retail sales during the holidays were above year-ago     levels. While the pace of spending was sluggish in a number of districts at     the beginning of the period, it picked up appreciably by late December. Adding     to the strength in household spending was an increase in tourism in several     districts. Most districts reported that manufacturing activity firmed and many     districts said that businesses planned to increase capital spending in 2005.     Although several reports noted some slowing in residential real estate and construction     activity, real estate markets remained generally strong. In the financial sector,     lending activity was mixed, as modestly higher commercial and industrial lending     was tempered by slower residential mortgage lending. Several districts noted     that agricultural conditions were favorable and that activity in the energy     sector remained strong. Labor markets firmed in a number of districts, but wage     pressures generally remained modest. Several districts reported higher prices     for building materials and manufacturing inputs, but most reported steady or     only slightly higher overall price levels.   Consumer Spending and Tourism    Consumer spending increased in most districts since the last Beige Book report,     with only Cleveland, Dallas, and New York reporting that sales were mixed. Boston,     Chicago, Dallas, New York, Richmond, and San Francisco said that retail sales     were slow in early December but picked up the pace from Christmas through the     end of the year. Sales of luxury goods were strong in the Kansas City, Philadelphia,     and San Francisco districts, while retailers in the Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas     City districts reported that electronics and jewelry sold well during the holiday     season. Boston, Richmond, and San Francisco reported higher sales of building     supplies, and Boston, Chicago, and St. Louis noted stronger sales of apparel.     Gift cards sold briskly according to the Chicago, Kansas City, Minneapolis,     and New York reports. Post-holiday retail inventories were at satisfactory levels     in the Kansas City, New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco districts.  Automobile sales were mixed. Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, and Kansas City     noted higher sales, but St. Louis and Dallas said new car sales slowed. Atlanta,     Philadelphia, and San Francisco noted that sales of foreign cars outperformed     domestic makes. Dealers in the Chicago, Dallas, and Philadelphia districts reported     that automobile dealers' inventories remained above desired levels.  Tourist activity strengthened in several districts. Boston said that increased     business travel, corporate spending, citywide conventions and increased international     travel boosted hotel occupancy rates. Occupancy rates were also up in the San     Francisco district, and the number of Japanese visitors to Hawaii has returned     to pre-September 11 levels. New York noted that tourist activity was higher     both upstate and in New York City where Broadway theaters set a box-office record     during the last week of the year. In addition, the Atlanta report indicated     that tourism was strong and that central Florida theme parks were filled to     capacity. Kansas City indicated that some ski resorts in the district reported     near-record levels of visitors. Richmond reported that because of unseasonably     mild weather, hotels were booked to capacity in coastal areas and that some     were turning tourists away during the week after Christmas.   Services    The Dallas, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and St. Louis districts reported     steady to stronger demand at services firms since the last Beige Book. Atlanta,     Dallas, San Francisco, and St. Louis noted stronger demand for transportation     services, with some seaports in the Atlanta district posting double-digit gains     in both inbound and outbound shipping. Air passenger traffic was higher at airports     in the Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City, and New York districts while air freight     volume increased in the Atlanta district. New York's report also noted     that the securities industry ended 2004 on a strong note.   Manufacturing    Manufacturing activity strengthened since the last Beige Book report. Nine of     the 12 districts indicated that factory output rose, while Chicago, Cleveland,     and Richmond noted that production was steady. Boston, Philadelphia, and San     Francisco indicated that demand for transportation equipment strengthened measurably.     Production of electrical machinery increased in the Philadelphia district, and     Chicago reported strong output of heavy equipment. Atlanta, Dallas, and San     Francisco reported that production of building materials picked up, while Chicago     and San Francisco indicated that orders for machine tools increased in their     districts. San Francisco also reported that semiconductor orders and sales were     generally solid.  But some manufacturing sectors weakened. Richmond reported that textiles and     apparel shipments continued to decline. Atlanta reported layoffs at a computer     circuit board plant, and Dallas noted slowing demand in consumer communications     equipment. Philadelphia indicated that demand softened for lumber and wood products,     paper products, and plastics, and Cleveland reported that sales at automobile     industry suppliers slowed at year-end. St. Louis said that firms in the fabricated     metal product, wood product, chemical, and apparel industries announced plant     closings and layoffs.  Looking ahead, manufacturers expected conditions to remain positive in coming     months. Most districts reported that manufacturers intend to increase their     capital spending in 2005. Firms in the Chicago district upped their planned     capital expenditures for next year; most have already begun to place orders     to accomplish those spending goals. Minneapolis indicated that expectations     of higher sales by businesses led to plans to increase capital spending in 2005.     Kansas City noted greater capital spending in 2005 to replace outdated equipment.     Richmond reported that manufacturers planned to increase capital spending despite     their skepticism about the sustainability of the U.S. economic recovery.  Construction and Real Estate    Residential real estate activity generally remained strong. Atlanta, Boston,     New York, Richmond, and San Francisco said that housing markets in their districts     continued to show strength in the fourth quarter of 2004, and Dallas and St.     Louis reported some improvement since the last Beige Book. Chicago reported     mixed housing activity, possibly because of a seasonal slowdown in December,     but noted a slight pickup in sales during the first week of January; real estate     activity was also mixed in the Minneapolis district. The Kansas City District     reported flat to slightly higher home sales compared with a year earlier. New     York reported that prices for upper-end New Jersey properties leveled off, or     pulled back, but that prices for Manhattan co-ops and condos continued to rise.     Richmond said home prices continued to rise in most areas of that district.     Commercial real estate conditions strengthened in most districts in December     and early January. Real estate agents in the Dallas, New York, Richmond, San     Francisco, and St. Louis districts reported that leasing activity increased--particularly     for office space. Office leasing was especially brisk in Washington, D.C., and     New York City, two of the nation's strongest commercial markets. Contacts     in New York said the recent uptick in activity sent the Class A office vacancy     rate to a two-and-a-half-year low and may be a signal of increased hiring in     that area. In other districts, vacancies were mixed--rates dipped in San     Francisco, St. Louis, and most of the Kansas City District, but were generally     unchanged in other areas. Adding to the positive tone, commercial construction     activity was higher since the last Beige Book report--contacts in Atlanta,     Chicago, Minnesota, Richmond, and St. Louis reported new industrial or office     construction activity, while retail construction maintained a generally steady     pace.   Banking and Finance    Lending activity remained generally mixed as slower residential mortgage lending     offset somewhat higher commercial and industrial lending in many districts.     Commercial lending was modestly higher in the Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco     districts while commercial and industrial lending was stronger in the Kansas     City, Philadelphia, and St. Louis districts. Residential mortgage lending, however,     declined in the Chicago, Dallas, and New York districts.   Several districts reported that credit conditions were steady, though Dallas     added that competition between banks in that district could threaten credit     quality in the months ahead. In addition, Chicago and San Francisco reported     that banks' profit margins on loans were thin.  Agriculture and Natural Resources    Several districts noted that crop and livestock conditions were generally favorable,     despite widely varying weather conditions. Richmond indicated that unseasonably     warm weather in early December accelerated the development of winter grains     and extended the grazing period for livestock. But very cold temperatures and     snowfall in late December led to supplemental feeding of livestock. A major     snow storm affected part of the St. Louis District in late December, leaving     fields and pastures muddy. Despite the excess soil moisture, St. Louis said     the winter wheat crop was in mostly fair to good condition. Minneapolis noted     that Montana's 2005 winter wheat crop was good to excellent despite little     snow cover to protect against freeze or wind damage. Kansas City added that     some producers in the western part of its district remained concerned that dry     pastures could deteriorate further.   Agricultural prices were generally higher. The Chicago district reported that     net farm income jumped last year as a result of profitable livestock operations     and record corn and soybean harvests, much of which was forward-contracted at     unusually high prices. In addition, Minneapolis reported milk prices were higher.     Activity in the energy industry remained strong according to reports from     the Dallas, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and San Francisco districts. Minneapolis     indicated increased mining activity, noting that the delivery of some mining     machinery required two-year waits. Kansas City reported that oil and gas drilling     rig counts remained well above year-ago levels, and noted constraints on drilling     due to labor and equipment shortages. Dallas added that the level of land drilling     was mostly unchanged but that offshore activity had picked up.   Labor Markets    Districts generally reported firmer labor markets in late 2004. Contacts in     Dallas, Kansas City, Minneapolis, New York, and Richmond reported improvement     on the job front, while respondents in Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco saw     little change in hiring activity.   Manufacturing employment rose in Kansas City, New York, Richmond and St. Louis,     while factory owners in Philadelphia anticipated adding workers in coming months.     Planned factory hiring in Cleveland was mixed by product type--producers of     nondurable goods predicted little change in future hiring, but makers of durable     goods anticipated adding to their payrolls in the months ahead. Services sector     respondents in Dallas, Richmond, and St. Louis reported broad-based strengthening     in services sector employment, and contacts in New York and Philadelphia noted     a particularly strong pickup in securities industry hiring.   Information on employment staffing services firms was mostly positive, but     varied by district. Contacts in Cleveland, New York, Philadelphia, and St. Louis     reported a moderate to brisk rise in demand, but Richmond noted generally flat     activity and Dallas reported a softening in demand for temporary workers. Chicago     also experienced a modest decline, but attributed it to a normal seasonal lull.     The reports from Kansas City, Minneapolis, and San Francisco indicated that     wage increases generally continued to be modest. However, Cleveland noted that     in response to the strong pickup in shipping demand, trucking firms have been     attempting to expand their workforce by raising their wage rates and offering     nonpecuniary incentives. Kansas City also noted higher wages for skilled factory     workers in short supply, while Richmond noted that wage increases picked up     in the services sector.  Prices    Inflationary pressures remained largely in check in December and early January.     While many manufacturers and builders continued to report small increases in     input costs, price increases for final goods and services were generally modest.     In manufacturing, input prices rose modestly in most districts, but Boston     and Minneapolis reported that some input prices rose sharply. Manufacturers     of nondurable goods in the Cleveland district noted that prices for raw materials     continued to rise, while prices for durable goods inputs were steady. Prices     charged by manufacturers increased modestly in Kansas City, New York, and Richmond,     and remained in check in Atlanta and Chicago. Increases in the costs of building     materials were mixed by district. Modest to sharp price hikes were widely reported     in Atlanta, Kansas City, and Minneapolis, but material prices were flat in Cleveland     and New York, and eased somewhat in San Francisco.  Overall, price inflation remained relatively steady in recent weeks. Reports     from Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Kansas City, New York, Richmond, and San Francisco     reported that price increases remained largely in check. Contacts in Dallas     noted that many firms were unable to pass rising costs along to the customer     due to stiff competition, and Chicago noted that competition in the retail sector     is expected to limit price increases.",2005-01-19
24,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and based on information collected on or before February 28, 2005.  This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.   Information received from District Banks suggests that the economy has continued to expand at a moderate pace since the last report.  All twelve Districts indicated that economic activity has increased, though Richmond reported some deceleration in the pace of growth, while Dallas noted some acceleration.  Relatively brisk growth was reported in the New York and San Francisco Districts. Consumer spending was steady to up moderately, with a number of Districts noting sluggish auto sales.  Retailers were mostly satisfied with current inventory levels and were generally optimistic about the outlook.  Travel and tourism activity were characterized as strong, with a few exceptions.  Reports from most other service industries also showed improvement.  Nearly all Districts reported continued expansion in manufacturing activity.  Housing markets and residential construction activity were described as robust in most areas, but commercial real estate markets were mixed.  Most Districts reported little change in overall loan demand, though a few indicated some pickup. Labor markets strengthened in almost all Districts; while wages continued to increase at a moderate pace, employers in many Districts reported ongoing pressures from higher benefit costs.  Many Districts reported increased difficulty in locating skilled workers for at least some industries.  A number of Districts reported increases in prices for manufactures and materials, but others noted some easing of input costs; prices of consumer goods and services were mixed but relatively flat, on balance. Consumer Spending and Tourism  Consumer spending has been steady to somewhat stronger since the last report.  Overall retail sales strengthened in Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas.  However, sales were reported to have been little changed in the other Districts.  A number of reports from retailers indicated that apparel sold well, but others noted weak sales of electronics and big-ticket items.  Automobile sales have been steady to softer in early 2005.  Vehicle sales weakened in Richmond, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco, while sales were said to be mixed in Cleveland, St. Louis, and Minneapolis.  The Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts reported that auto sales picked up in February, after a sluggish January.  Overall, retail inventories were said to be at satisfactory levels, though automobile inventories were said to be on the high side in Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas. Tourism showed increased strength in most Districts, though a few reported that activity was hampered by unfavorable weather.  Robust tourism activity was noted in New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco; New York attributed some of the strength to the Central Park ""Gates"" exhibit, Richmond cited unseasonably warm weather, and Atlanta noted some positive effect from the weaker dollar.   On the other hand, Boston and Minneapolis indicated some softness in tourism, partly attributed to an unusual geographic distribution of winter snow. Services  Activity in service-sector industries showed signs of strengthening since the last report.  Boston, St. Louis, and San Francisco reported some pickup in demand for information technology services.  New York reported strong conditions in the securities industry, and Dallas noted brisk demand for accounting services.  Widespread strength was evident in the trucking and shipping industries: conditions were described as robust in Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Dallas and San Francisco, and steady in Richmond.  Conditions in the airline industry were mixed: Dallas reported weak conditions, while Chicago noted strong demand from business travelers, but some softness in the domestic leisure segment.  More broadly, St. Louis and San Francisco cited general increases in service-sector activity, while Richmond reported that conditions were stable. Manufacturing  Manufacturing activity was reported as expanding solidly in most Districts, although the pace of growth has generally not increased since the last report. Many Districts noted particularly strong gains in durable goods manufacturing.  Defense-related production was reported as strong in the Boston, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts; machine tool production was described as solid by several Districts; vehicle production remained at a high level, in part because of the strength in demand for heavy trucks; and construction materials were in high demand. Steel shipments softened in Cleveland, but were reported as solid in Chicago; Cleveland cited surging steel imports, whereas Chicago saw imports decline.  High-tech manufacturing activity was reported as growing in the Dallas and Boston Districts but mixed in San Francisco, where the semiconductor industry showed strength but the telecommunications industry remained weak. Sustained increases in the cost of energy, steel, and other materials were widespread. However, some moderation in the pace of cost increases was reported by the New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland Districts, with a faster rate of increase noted only by the Richmond District. A recent drop in energy prices was cited by some Districts as helping to stabilize input price increases. The weaker dollar reportedly has stimulated exports in the Atlanta District, although some Districts cited the dollar's decline as exerting continuing upward price pressures on imported inputs. Several Districts noted that their manufacturing contacts were optimistic that the coming year would bring continued growth, with some seeing expansion of factory headcounts. Real Estate and Construction  Home sales markets remained strong across most of the nation.  New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco continued to describe  housing markets as robust.  However, mixed conditions were reported in Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas.  The market for apartments was characterized as soft in Dallas, mixed in Chicago, but strong in New York.  Home construction has been particularly brisk in the San Francisco and Atlanta Districts, whereas Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas indicated some pullback. Commercial real estate markets were, on balance, stable.  Office markets were steady in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, and Dallas, with Boston and Dallas noting substantial ongoing slack in the market.  On the other hand, some firming was reported in the Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts.  Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Minneapolis reported some pickup in the market for industrial space, but Boston, New York, and Richmond reported steady to somewhat softer markets.  Richmond noted a slight decline in retail vacancy rates. There were scattered reports of increases in commercial construction activity.  Philadelphia reported an increase in industrial building, Cleveland reported a pickup in retail construction, and Richmond noted two major office projects in the pipeline.  Some general, albeit modest, increases in commercial construction were also reported in Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco. Banking and Finance  Banks reported steady to somewhat stronger lending activity in early 2005.  The Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Richmond Districts noted increases in overall loan demand.  Rising demand for commercial mortgages was reported in New York, Cleveland, Richmond, and Kansas City, while San Francisco described demand as slowing but strong; Dallas, however, noted an increase in commercial property foreclosures.  Business lending also strengthened in a number of Districts, but the reports on household loan demand were mixed, suggesting little change, on balance, for both consumer loans and residential mortgages.  Home equity lending strengthened noticeably in the Philadelphia and Cleveland Districts but slipped in Kansas City. Credit standards were unchanged across the board, and loan quality was widely described as steady and strong. Contacts in Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco indicated that the lending environment was highly competitive, leading to narrowing margins, while contacts in Dallas expressed some concern about excessive supply of funds available to commercial mortgage markets. Agriculture and Natural Resources  Above-average rainfall and moisture levels were reported in several Districts, which created a mix of favorable and unfavorable conditions. In the Dallas, Kansas City, and St. Louis Districts, heavy precipitation helped planting conditions for the winter wheat crop but proved problematic for other crops.  Improved conditions for livestock grazing were reported in the San Francisco, Dallas, and Kansas City Districts. Atlanta's citrus industry continued to suffer from the after-effects of last year's hurricanes, as well as disease. Activity in the energy industry was reported as buoyant and optimistic, given the continuing pattern of higher energy prices. The Dallas and Kansas City Districts reported an increase in active rigs since the last report. Capacity in the industry is being strained by labor and equipment availability, although activity is expected to continue to improve. Labor Markets  Labor markets across the nation have been steady to stronger since the last report.  Ongoing improvements in labor market conditions were reported in Boston, New York, Atlanta, and Minneapolis, and hiring activity has picked up recently in Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City.  Brisk gains in temporary employment were seen in Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago, while, in Dallas, these job gains fell short of expectations. Manufacturers were reported to be raising employment in the Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, and Minneapolis Districts.  On the other hand, manufacturing employment has been steady to lower, on net, in Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City.  A number of industries have seen tightening labor markets across several Districts.  Increased labor demand was reported in financial services (Boston, New York, Kansas City, and Dallas), legal services (New York, Minneapolis, and Dallas), and freight transportation and distribution (Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, and Kansas City).  There were also reports of scattered skilled labor shortages in many Districts.  New York and Cleveland noted a dwindling supply of skilled workers to fill job openings generally; and a number of other Districts reported shortages of skilled job applicants in specific industries, such as trucking, shipping, construction, energy, health care, and media. Overall wage increases were characterized as moderate in all Districts.  Still, a number of Districts cited larger wage gains in certain industries, including securities (New York), trucking (Cleveland and Kansas City), legal services (Minneapolis and Dallas), pharmaceutical services (Kansas City), and accounting (Kansas City and Dallas).  Reports of ongoing sharp increases in benefit costs, particularly health insurance, were fairly widespread. Prices  Retail prices were generally flat or up modestly; however, businesses continued to face rising input costs, and a number of Districts indicated greater ease in passing along price increases.  Prices for finished goods were reported to be increasing modestly in Richmond and Minneapolis, but almost all of the other Districts characterized retail prices as flat.  Cleveland and Chicago reported that motor vehicle prices were being reduced by increased incentives and discounts.  A number of Districts also noted ongoing declines in apparel prices. Despite the stability in consumer goods prices, manufacturers in a number of     Districts--including Boston, Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas--indicated that     they have been finding it increasingly easy to pass along price increases; Philadelphia     producers anticipated greater ability to boost prices in the near future. Also,     truckers in the Cleveland and Atlanta Districts indicated that they have been     offsetting rising fuel costs with surcharges. A number of Districts reported persistent pressures on input costs, though some noted that these have eased since the last report.  Firms in Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco reported sizable increases in prices of various raw materials.  The most commonly mentioned were construction materials (especially steel) and fuel. Quite a few Districts also mentioned continued rapid escalation in health insurance costs, though San Francisco indicated that these have decelerated. More generally, New York, Cleveland and Chicago indicated that input cost pressures have abated somewhat since the last report.",2005-03-09
25,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and based on information collected on or before April 11, 2005.  This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.   Reports from all twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that business activity continued to expand from late February through early April.  Kansas City and San Francisco noted solid growth, Chicago and Dallas characterized growth as moderate, and Atlanta reported a robust pace.  By contrast, while citing positive growth, New York and Cleveland mentioned uneven progress across sectors, and Richmond stated that signs of improvement in April followed a restrained March. More than one-half of the Districts reported that retail activity was up, from modestly to strongly.  Among the remaining Districts, Chicago said consumer spending was subdued, Dallas noted that retailers were disappointed with recent growth, and Cleveland reported some deterioration after improvement earlier in the year.  Tourism was generally doing well in those Districts that mentioned it. Districts described manufacturing activity as ahead of year-earlier or previously-reported levels, with reports ranging from ""rising briskly"" in the Kansas City District to ""continuing at solid levels"" for contacts around Chicago.  Information on service industries was generally positive.  Residential real estate markets remained strong across most of the country, while commercial real estate conditions varied.  Price pressures have intensified in a number of Districts, and most report that high or rising energy prices are a concern across sectors. Consumer Spending and Tourism  The majority of Districts experienced improving retail sales overall, but several showed flat or disappointing results.  In Minneapolis, contacts indicated that retail sales increased between 5 percent and 12 percent over the previous year.  St. Louis also reported strong growth, with Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco recording modest to solid gains.  Among the remaining five Districts, New York, Chicago, and Dallas characterized consumer spending growth as either subdued or disappointing, while Cleveland and Richmond cited mixed trends during the reporting period.  Contacts in these five Districts attributed sluggish spending in part to unfavorable weather conditions, and in part to high or rising energy and gasoline prices.  Retail selling prices were described as reasonably stable to date, although some contacts cited evidence of increased prices and pricing power. New vehicle sales were flat or slightly up in most of the Districts reporting on this category.  The exceptions were San Francisco, which reported strong sales, and Dallas, where car sales were weaker than a year ago.  Contacts in several Districts also mentioned softening demand for domestic vehicles, especially trucks and SUVs, although most dealers in the Richmond District said they had not seen a shift to smaller cars despite higher gasoline prices.  In other product categories, apparel and jewelry sales were strong in many regions. Spending on travel and tourism improved throughout much of the country. New York and San Francisco reported brisk activity compared with a year ago, citing rising occupancy rates and higher revenues per room.  Bolstered by foreign visitors, Florida recorded high passenger counts on cruise lines and robust bookings at theme parks.  Boston, Philadelphia, and Kansas City also reported stronger tourist-related growth. Weather was an important factor in the Richmond, Chicago, and Minneapolis Districts, as areas with favorable winter weather enjoyed increased business while those with bad weather saw flat or sluggish growth. Service Industries  In general, firms in the service sector enjoyed a moderate increase in activity.  St. Louis reported expansion in most areas, and San Francisco noted solid demand growth, especially in health-care, transportation, and food services.  According to Atlanta, temporary employee hiring maintained a brisk pace, while Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Richmond observed some pickup in demand at employment agencies.  By contrast, Chicago and Dallas indicated more modest growth at temporary staffing firms.  Demand for trucking and shipping services in several Districts reportedly eased somewhat as firms began passing on higher fuel costs to customers.  However, Philadelphia reported increased trucking activity despite higher freight rates.  Dallas cited strong conditions in the accounting industry, while business at law firms remained unchanged.  Boston identified robust demand at both advertising and management consulting firms. Manufacturing   The updates on manufacturing were largely positive.  Eleven of the twelve Districts indicated that production or orders were rising, while Chicago characterized activity as continuing at solid levels with the exception of continued weakness in light vehicle production.  Several Districts with largely upbeat reports nevertheless indicated that increases in manufacturing output may be moderating a little.  For example, New York cited a ""loss of momentum"" in the manufacturing sector, and Cleveland stated that ""many firms noted flattening new orders growth"" for durable goods. Districts reported strong or rising demand for various durable goods, including building materials, machinery and machine tools, fabricated metals, energy-related equipment, and defense equipment.  Shortages of tires and metal parts were said to be constraining heavy truck and other production in Chicago, Minneapolis, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Manufacturers in all Districts were reportedly facing rising costs for a variety of inputs, most notably energy, transportation, petrochemicals, and other petroleum-based products.  Moreover, according to Dallas, expansions of petrochemical capacity are not expected to provide price relief for at least another year.  On the other hand, several Districts mentioned that steel prices were stabilizing, albeit at high levels, and Philadelphia's survey revealed that the number of companies saying prices had risen in March was lower than it had been during the fall and early winter. Overall, manufacturers' output prices appear to be rising modestly.  Most Districts found that firms were having partial success passing on higher energy and materials costs to their customers.  However, several cited instances of firms having to rescind price increases and accept lower margins.  Reduced margins remained the norm in the Cleveland District, and rising energy costs were specified as a source of ""concern"" or ""caution"" among manufacturers in New York, St. Louis, and Dallas. Labor demand in the manufacturing sector appears to be mixed, with some Districts placing more emphasis on additions to employment and others on cutbacks.  District reports on capital spending tended to be moderately positive.  Kansas City referred to ""solid growth"" in capital investment, and Philadelphia took note of the fact that very few companies expect to reduce their capital spending in the coming six months.  Nevertheless, Boston described manufacturers as ""closely managing"" their capital expenditures. Real Estate and Construction  Residential real estate markets were very active during March and early April, with Districts noting increased activity levels compared with the previous report.  Demand for houses was strong and residential sales were high in three-quarters of the Districts.  New York, Richmond, and Atlanta cited low housing inventories, while Boston mentioned increased time on the market for high-priced homes.  Several Districts indicated that home prices rose. Reports on new housing construction were more mixed.  Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco said the pace of home construction was strong or picking up, but St. Louis and Dallas noted slower residential construction. Commercial real estate markets varied.  Office vacancy rates declined in New York, Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco.  New commercial construction was robust in Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Dallas and San Francisco, but slow in Richmond.  Chicago reported steady vacancy and rental rates.  Banking and Finance   For most Districts reporting on financial services, demand for loans increased across a range of categories.  Almost all Districts mentioned increases in commercial lending activity, and Philadelphia, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco noted industrial lending as an area of strength.  The Cleveland District cited increased demand for loans to the manufacturing industry, specifically.  Reports on demand for mortgages were mixed, and the New York, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts noted weakness in refinancing activity.  Demand for non-bank financial services was disappointing, with New York reporting a recent slowing in the securities industry, and investment companies from the Philadelphia District noting general caution on the part of investors. Other banking indicators were holding steady or improving in some cases.  Philadelphia and Kansas City reported growth in deposits, while Cleveland cited rising core deposits at larger banks.  Credit conditions and delinquency rates have improved according to the New York, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts, and held roughly the same in the Dallas and Chicago Districts. Agriculture and Natural Resources  Planting activities are under way in the agricultural Districts, which generally reported good spring conditions.  By exception, wet weather has caused delays in parts of the Richmond and Atlanta Districts, while drought conditions continued or worsened in parts of the Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts. Still, contacts indicated that the winter wheat and other crops are generally in good shape, as are range land, pasturage, and livestock.  However, canker disease required destruction of part of the Florida citrus crop. In addition, growers in the Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Districts are cutting planned soybean acreage, reflecting some concern about soybean rust.  Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco contacts noted that fuel, fertilizer, and other input costs are rising.  Chicago bankers voiced concern that higher rents and interest rates could adversely affect cash flow at large farming operations.  Atlanta contacts reported strong export demand for cotton and poultry, while Dallas noted improved selling prices for wheat, corn, and soybeans and favorable prices for livestock. Minneapolis, Kansas City and Dallas reported that activity in the energy sector is revving up. According to contacts in Dallas, the U.S. rig count is at the highest level since 1986, and drilling plans are increasing faster than predicted earlier this year.  Kansas City respondents noted that shortages of labor and equipment are keeping drilling activity slightly below desired levels at some firms, while some Dallas contacts say they are thinking of adding capacity.  In San Francisco, drilling costs are rising.  Dallas contacts report that producers are turning their attention to coal-bed methane, tight gas, tar sands, and gas shale, while service companies seek to create new products to support the development of unconventional resources.  In the Minneapolis District, a large-scale wind energy project is planned for Montana.  Mining activity is also on the rise, with output stable or growing at Montana's iron, palladium/platinum, and copper mines. Prices and Wages   Reports from many Districts suggested that upward price pressures have strengthened, although actual increases to date in vendor prices and selling prices have generally remained moderate.  Much of the pressure derives from energy costs, although contacts cited the lower dollar and rising costs of building materials as well.  Most Districts said manufacturers, retailers, or services firms were able to pass at least a portion of cost increases along to their customers. However, only Chicago and Dallas suggested that some contacts have raised prices enough to increase margins or profits. In two-thirds of the Districts, retail or tourism contacts expressed concern that high energy prices were already, or could soon be, damping consumer demand.  Distribution (shipping, trucking, freight, delivery) firms and utilities shared similar apprehensions, having imposed fuel surcharges in many cases, according to Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Minneapolis.  As noted above, manufacturers also mentioned rising energy costs.  San Francisco stated that increasing costs have prompted manufacturers to ""keep production as close as possible to demand,"" and Dallas indicated that uncertainty about energy prices has added caution to the outlook for business activity. Boston, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City reported modest or moderate wage increases in various sectors, as labor markets in a few areas or occupations became somewhat tighter.  By contrast, Cleveland cited stable wages in trucking, and Dallas said its contacts saw little or no wage pressure.  Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco indicated that benefits costs, especially health care, continue to rise.",2005-04-20
26,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and based on information collected before June 6, 2005. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.   Reports from all twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that business activity continued to expand from mid-April through May.  Most Districts--including New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minnesota, Kansas City, and San Francisco--characterized the pace of expansion as moderate, solid, or well-sustained.  However, Philadelphia noted that the pace of growth had eased in May while Boston and Cleveland observed some unevenness across sectors. Retail activity was mixed.  Several Districts reported disappointing May retail sales results and cited unseasonable weather as the principal reason.  A few reports mentioned that high gasoline prices were having a negative impact on sales.  Almost all reports on other service industries were quite positive.  Residential real estate markets remained strong in most Districts, and several Districts reported improving commercial real estate conditions.  Most Districts reported that manufacturing activity continued to expand overall, although some reports described varying conditions across industries. Labor markets improved in most Districts.  Overall price pressures were moderate, but several reports noted concern over high fuel, transportation, and building materials costs.  Consumer Spending  Reports on retail sales in April and May were mixed.  Richmond reported that May sales and store traffic picked up markedly, and Kansas City noted that consumer spending expanded solidly in April and May.  St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco also reported gains in consumer spending.  Sales were characterized as mixed by merchants in Atlanta and Cleveland and as having edged down in the Philadelphia District.  Chicago retailers described sales as subdued, and those in New York reported sales as soft.  Boston, New York, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, and Minneapolis noted that unseasonable weather had dampened sales in May.  In addition, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas said that high gasoline prices had a negative impact on retail sales. Automobile sales were reported as mixed by Atlanta, Kansas City, Chicago, and Dallas, sluggish in Cleveland, and down in the Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and St. Louis Districts.  Meanwhile vehicle inventories were above desired levels according to Chicago, Philadelphia, and Dallas.  Dealers in the Philadelphia area boosted leasing promotions to lower some excess inventories.  Atlanta and San Francisco noted that high gasoline prices were having a negative impact on sales of SUVs and light trucks.  Services and Tourism    According to most reports, industries in the service sector continued to display solid growth in April and May.  Dallas reported that the transportation industry continued to experience strong demand conditions, but also noted concerns about high fuel costs.  San Francisco reported that demand for media and high-tech services strengthened and that activity among transportation, food, and healthcare service providers remained vigorous.  Reports from the tourism and hospitality industry remained positive.  Tourism remained exceptionally strong in New York City.  Manhattan's hotel occupancy rate was more than 2 percentage points higher in April than a year ago and average room rates were up 17 percent.  Richmond said that hotel bookings at coastal hotels for the Memorial Day weekend were somewhat stronger than a year earlier and that rapidly rising demand for hotel rooms in the nation's capital drove room rates sharply higher in recent months.  Atlanta also noted that hotel and resort occupancies were at high levels.  St. Louis reported strong sales and employment gains in the hospitality services industry, and San Francisco reported that the travel and tourism sector continued to surge.  Spring tourism was flat because of cool weather according to Minneapolis, but tourism officials remained optimistic about the summer season. Construction and Real Estate    Reports on residential real estate markets remained quite positive overall, although some slowing in activity was noted in a few markets.  Philadelphia and Atlanta reported that home sales were brisk and strong, respectively.  St. Louis reported that home sales continued to rise, while Kansas City and Chicago stated that activity remained solid.  San Francisco reported that home sales continued to be rapid, although growth slowed somewhat relative to previous periods.  Richmond and New York said that housing markets remained strong, but both noted some easing in demand in high-end markets.  Minneapolis described real estate markets as mixed.  New home sales weakened slightly, according to Cleveland, and Dallas noted that in some parts of the District the supply of new homes had outstripped demand.  St. Louis and Minneapolis cited permit data that indicated some moderation in construction is likely. Several Districts reported improvements in commercial real estate markets.  New York and Dallas saw signs of strengthening activity, with office vacancy rates retreating in several local markets.  Leasing activity has been fairly strong, according to Philadelphia, and Richmond noted that rents firmed and new construction has increased.  Atlanta saw solid improvements as firms moved forward with expansion plans; development also increased at a steady pace in Cleveland and Chicago and continued to improve in San Francisco.  Modest improvements were noted by Kansas City and Minneapolis.  However, St. Louis reported that commercial markets were mixed, and Boston noted that local markets continued to struggle. Manufacturing   Most Districts reported that manufacturing activity continued to expand, although several Districts noted that production had slowed or leveled off.  Atlanta and San Francisco reported that defense contracts had generated new orders for local manufacturers, while Boston and San Francisco cited strong demand for aircraft-related and computing equipment.  Durable goods production was improving, according to Minneapolis and Cleveland, although Cleveland noted that steel production was softer.  Boston and Dallas described manufacturing activity as mixed overall, and the pace of expansion, although positive, had reportedly slowed in some industries, according to San Francisco, Chicago, and Philadelphia.  St. Louis, Boston, Minneapolis, and Chicago cited varying degrees of weakness in vehicle production, although Cleveland reported year-over-year gains in auto production in the two-month period ending in May.  Several reports noted that manufacturing firms are planning to increase capital spending, open or expand plants, and increase operations to meet expected demand.  The majority of Districts reported manufacturer concerns regarding higher input prices, especially in energy-related goods.   Banking and Finance   For most Districts reporting on financial services, the demand for loans either increased or remained solid.  Most Districts cited increases in commercial lending activity, although Richmond noted a slower pace in some areas.  Philadelphia linked new commercial borrowing to rising capital expenditures by firms in a wide range of industries.  Atlanta and Chicago reported stronger consumer loan demand, but St. Louis and New York reported some slowdown, and Cleveland described activity as mixed.  Residential real estate lending was described as rising or remaining solid in most Districts.  Dallas reported some concern about a potential glut in multi-family residential properties.  Other banking indicators were holding steady or improving, and credit quality was described as good. Labor Markets and Prices  Labor market conditions continued to improve in most Districts, and several reports cited difficulty finding specific types of workers.  For instance, Dallas reported a shortage of skilled workers in the energy industry, while Atlanta and San Francisco noted similar shortages in construction.  Cleveland reported that manufacturing firms had difficulty obtaining qualified applicants for job openings.  San Francisco described tighter supply conditions in nursing and financial service professions.  The demand for temporary workers strengthened in the Richmond, New York, and Atlanta Districts, while Chicago noted a small decline from a year earlier.  San Francisco and Dallas reported rising wages, mainly in professional services, while Minneapolis noted only modest increases in wages. Reports from most Districts indicated that price increases at the retail level remained modest overall.  San Francisco noted that price inflation for final goods and services edged up, largely because of the pass-through of earlier increases in energy costs.  Several Districts noted increases in transportation and healthcare costs.  Prices were up for construction-related materials, such as lumber, cement, brick, tile, and glass in many Districts.  Some Districts noted that manufacturers were unable to pass along rising costs of raw materials because of the presence of long-term contracts and competitive pressures from foreign producers.  However, Cleveland reported that firms have had some success in passing input cost increases along to their customers. Agriculture and Natural Resources  Despite less-than-ideal weather, crop conditions were described as between fair and good for most reporting Districts.  Cold weather slowed plantings and crop development, according to Richmond and Kansas City.  Also, heavy rains in California's central Valley region damaged some fruit crops.  Dallas and San Francisco noted concerns over higher costs of fuel and fertilizers. Activity in the energy industry has remained strong especially for oil field services.  Dallas reported strong drilling activity, long backlogs, and a dearth of skilled workers.  San Francisco and Minneapolis reported that producers were operating at or near full capacity.  Kansas City noted that drilling firms expected moderate expansion of drilling activity in the months ahead.",2005-06-15
27,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and   based on information collected on or before July 18, 2005. This document summarizes   comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve   and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.  Reports from all twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that economic activity     continued to expand in June and early July. Richmond and Dallas reported that     the rate of economic growth increased, and Cleveland said economic growth was     stronger and more balanced than in the spring. New York was the only District     to report a slowing in the rate of economic growth. Among the other Districts,     Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco characterized the pace     of expansion as solid, while Chicago described the rate of economic growth as     moderate. Boston, Philadelphia, and St. Louis did not characterize the overall     pace of expansion, although Boston noted that locally-based retailers were not     sharing in the expansion.  Most Districts reported increases in retail sales, and vehicle sales in nearly     all Districts were boosted by a new round of price discounting. Demand for most     services, including tourism, continued to increase across the country, and most     Districts noted moderate to solid expansions in manufacturing activity. Commercial     real estate activity improved in most Districts. Residential real estate activity     remained strong overall but showed a few signs of cooling in some Districts.     Bankers reported solid or increasing loan demand.  Labor markets generally continued to improve, although hiring in several Districts     was mixed. Skilled worker shortages were reported in several Districts, but     nearly all Districts said wage pressures remained moderate. Overall price pressures     eased slightly or remained unchanged in most Districts, despite substantial     increases in energy costs.  Consumer Spending    Most Districts reported increases in retail sales, and reports on retailers'     expectations were generally positive. Dallas said sales growth had been stronger     than expected given high gasoline prices, and Atlanta noted that higher gasoline     prices did not appear to have cut into spending on other items; Cleveland and     Chicago said warmer weather may have boosted sales in their Districts. Minneapolis     and Kansas City reported solid year-over-year retail sales gains, and sales     also increased in the Philadelphia, Richmond, and San Francisco Districts. The     weakest report on retail sales came from the Boston District, where sales were     flat or down from a year ago and retailers were less optimistic than in previous     surveys. New York also reported a softening in sales in early July following     solid growth in June, while St. Louis said reports on retail sales were mixed     in June.  Nearly all Districts that reported on vehicle sales noted improvements, which     were generally attributed to a new round of price discounting by some automakers.     Cleveland reported dramatic gains, saying all types of dealerships benefited     from increased buyer traffic. San Francisco also said vehicle sales rose substantially     in response to the price cuts. Only St. Louis cited mixed reports on auto sales.     Sales of most types of vehicles were characterized as strong, although Philadelphia     and Kansas City reported some weakness in sales of large SUVs. Auto dealers     in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts were somewhat concerned about future     auto sales, but Kansas City said dealers expect strong sales to continue.  Services and Tourism    Demand for services continued to increase in June and early July. Boston reported     healthy growth in demand for advertising and management consulting, and Philadelphia     contacts noted increased activity in information services and business support     services. Richmond also reported increased demand for business-to-business services.     Demand for health care was reported to be flat in the Richmond District but     robust in the San Francisco District. Dallas and San Francisco noted an increase     in demand at transportation firms, while Cleveland and Chicago said that demand     for trucking was steady and that overall conditions for the industry remained     favorable. On the other hand, Atlanta reported some transportation firms have     seen activity fall slightly from the high levels experienced earlier in the     year.   Tourism continued to show strength throughout much of the country. New York     reported that hotel occupancy rates in Manhattan were near record levels and     that room rates were up substantially from a year earlier. In addition, Atlanta     said hotel occupancy rates in the Miami area were at record levels, and theme     park attendance was ahead of last year's pace. Chicago and Kansas City also     noted an increase in demand for hotel rooms since the previous survey. Tourism     activity over the Fourth of July was characterized as being particularly strong     in parts of the Richmond and Minneapolis Districts. San Francisco reported continued     strong growth in visits to key tourist destination states.  Manufacturing    Most Districts reported moderate to solid expansions in manufacturing activity,     and expectations for future factory activity were generally upbeat. New York     saw a rebound in manufacturing production in July, adding that manufacturers'     expectations had also risen. Chicago reported continued solid growth, and Atlanta     said that reports from District manufacturers were positive. Boston said sales     and orders remain on an upward trend. Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Dallas     noted increases in activity as well. St. Louis and Kansas City reported moderate     expansions in factory activity, and San Francisco said demand for manufactured     goods rose slightly after slowing in the previous survey period. Cleveland said     durable goods production had been flat since the previous survey but nondurable     goods production was steady or rising. Richmond reported a softening in factory     activity in June but a solid increase in shipments and new orders in July. Despite     the overall expansion in manufacturing activity, as well as generally positive     reports on capital spending, factory hiring remained sluggish in most Districts     that reported on employment.   Activity in a wide variety of manufacturing industries was characterized as     strong. Boston and San Francisco reported strength in aircraft and high-tech     manufacturing, and Atlanta and Dallas said refineries were doing quite well.     Several Districts also noted strong activity for producers of construction materials--especially     cement--as well as for producers of industrial equipment and materials. While     most factory sectors were strong, some weakness was noted among producers of     metals and textiles.  Construction and Real Estate    Residential real estate activity remained robust overall but showed a few signs     of cooling in some Districts. Boston reported that residential real estate markets     were still strong. However, housing activity and home price appreciation in     Massachusetts moved from ""hot"" to ""normal,"" and housing inventories in the District     as a whole became somewhat less tight. Housing activity was described as robust     in the New York District, but housing inflation slowed in New Jersey and the     condo market in Manhattan was less frenzied than in the spring. In the Richmond,     Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts, housing activity remained strong but eased     in a few markets that had been especially hot--Washington, D.C., several Florida     markets, and parts of southern California. Dallas also described housing demand     as strong but noted that the supply of new homes was sufficient to keep housing     inflation from exceeding overall inflation. Housing activity was brisk in the     Chicago District and solid in the Kansas City and Minneapolis Districts, although     homebuilding edged down in the Kansas City District. The weakest report came     from the Cleveland District, where homebuilders have faced slightly softer conditions     since early spring and new home prices have been flat.   Commercial real estate activity improved in most Districts. Cleveland said     commercial builders were experiencing steady improvement and higher backlogs     of orders. In the Atlanta District, new construction projects moved forward,     and office vacancy rates trended downward but were still high. Contacts in the     Chicago District described commercial activity as busier than normal, although     activity was slower in Michigan. Commercial real estate activity was described     as strong in the Richmond District and as improving in the Minneapolis, Kansas     City, and San Francisco Districts. Dallas reported that speculative office construction     increased, apartment construction remained high, and hotel markets were hot.     Some of the increased real estate demand in the Dallas District was attributed     to outside investors attracted by the area's lower real estate prices.   Banking and Finance    In Districts reporting on banking conditions, loan demand increased or remained     solid. Overall lending increased in most Districts, with growth ranging from     slight in the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts to solid in the Dallas District.     Atlanta and San Francisco both characterized loan demand as strong. In most     Districts, loan growth was attributed to increases in home mortgages, home equity     loans, or business loans. Credit quality was generally strong, although there     were some concerns about loans to auto suppliers and farmers in the Chicago     District and loans for Florida condominium developments in the Atlanta District.     Dallas indicated that competition for large commercial loans had intensified,     and Chicago said that competitive pressures had led to some easing of commercial     credit standards. Outside of the banking sector, cash inflows to investment     companies increased in the Philadelphia District, and venture capital rose for     the first time in five years in the Chicago District. New York and Richmond     also reported increased activity in the financial services sector as a whole.  Agriculture and Natural Resources    Although conditions remained favorable in most agricultural Districts, dry weather     was a problem in some areas. Richmond reported that substantial rainfall brought     on by two tropical storms generally improved soil conditions in the District.     Atlanta reported only limited damage to crops from the storms and favorable     crop conditions overall, although citrus canker continues to be of some concern     in Florida. Kansas City and Minneapolis also said that crop conditions were     mostly favorable, and winter wheat yields were above year-ago levels in both     Districts. Some Kansas City contacts reported concern about higher energy prices     boosting irrigation costs. Drought conditions were reported in the Chicago,     St. Louis, and Dallas Districts, and Chicago noted these conditions had led     to an increase in corn and soybean prices. The lack of rain caused pasture conditions     to deteriorate substantially in the St. Louis and Dallas Districts. San Francisco     reported little or no impact on cattle prices from renewed fears about mad cow     disease, while Kansas City reported that the resumption of live cattle imports     from Canada was contributing to downward pressure on cattle prices.  Activity in the energy industry remained strong. Oil and gas activity increased     in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts and remained steady in the Minneapolis     and Kansas City Districts. Kansas City reported that drilling was constrained     due to a shortage of available rigs and regulatory factors, and some oil service     firms in the Dallas District were turning down available work due to limited     capacity. Dallas contacts also noted difficulty finding qualified engineers     and training crews. Atlanta reported a temporary shut-in of some oil and natural     gas supplies in the Gulf of Mexico due to Hurricane Dennis. Minneapolis respondents     said that mines are operating at full capacity, with exploration activity in     full swing across the District.  Labor Markets, Wages, and Prices    The demand for labor continued to increase in most Districts, although hiring     in several Districts was mixed. Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City,     Dallas, and San Francisco all noted an overall firming in labor markets. Boston     reported moderate increases in services employment and mostly steady employment     in retail and manufacturing. In the Richmond District, jobs increased moderately     at services firms but declined slightly at manufacturing firms. New York said     labor markets were a bit softer overall despite a pickup in hiring in financial     services. Several Districts reported increased demand for temporary workers,     while no Districts reported weaker demand for temps. Skilled workers were said     to be in shorter supply in several Districts, and truck drivers were reported     as scarce in the Cleveland, Richmond, and Atlanta Districts.  Despite generally tighter labor markets, nearly all Districts said overall     wage pressures remained moderate. The only wage pressures cited by the Dallas     District were in the accounting and energy industries, and Chicago said the     only sizable wage gains were in some skilled professions experiencing labor     shortages. San Francisco also reported only modest overall wage growth but noted     an increasing use of incentive compensation by some employers to attract workers.     Rising health-care costs continued to be a concern for contacts in the Atlanta     and San Francisco Districts, but Chicago reported that one large health insurance     firm plans to implement the smallest premium increase in a decade.  Overall price pressures either eased slightly or remained unchanged in most     Districts, despite substantial increases in the costs of energy and some building     materials. Manufacturers in the New York District reported a marked deceleration     in input prices and expect substantially less upward price pressure in coming     months. Some moderation in input price increases was also noted in the Richmond,     Kansas City, and Cleveland Districts. Overall cost and price pressures were     described as mild in the Richmond District, moderate in the Chicago District,     and largely unchanged from the second quarter in the Philadelphia District.     Kansas City and Minneapolis noted some softening in the costs of steel. However,     many Districts reported substantial increases in the costs of energy, petroleum-based     products, and building materials such as concrete and plywood. Chicago, Cleveland,     and Dallas said that transportation firms were able to pass on much of their     increased fuel costs to customers. However, in a number of Districts, firms     outside the transportation sector were reported as having only limited success     passing on cost increases. Retail prices were reported as either flat or up     moderately from the previous survey.",2005-07-27
28,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and based on information collected before August 29, 2005 and, thus, before Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the Gulf Coast. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.  Economic activity increased across the nation from mid-July through August, except in the Boston District, where activity was mixed. The growth was widespread as retail sales, services, finance, construction, manufacturing, mining, energy, and tourism all expanded. A few Districts reported softening in residential real estate markets, albeit from still brisk levels of activity, while commercial real estate markets strengthened in most Districts. Lending activity increased, and credit quality was stable. Conditions in the agricultural sector improved slightly, with late summer rains somewhat alleviating the effects of drought. Meanwhile, labor markets showed signs of tightening with modest wage increases. Except for energy, overall consumer price increases were modest. Most Districts reported significant price increases in certain commodities and energy products, especially gasoline.   Consumer Spending   Most Districts saw an increase in retail sales. Minneapolis described sales as improving and strengthening, while sales were above year-ago levels in the Atlanta, Boston, and St. Louis Districts. Kansas City, Richmond, and San Francisco variously described consumer spending as expanded, brisk, or solid. Meanwhile, retail sales were about level with a year ago in New York and Philadelphia, and consumer spending was mixed in Dallas and weak in Cleveland. Back-to-school sales were strong in Kansas City, but slow in Philadelphia. Several Districts reported that retailers expect sales to be negatively affected by higher fuel prices.  Vehicle sales were up in all Districts. Cleveland, Kansas City, Philadelphia, and San Francisco reported strong sales, and Atlanta and St. Louis described recent vehicle sales as rising or improved. Most Districts cited the effect of manufacturer discounts; however, Chicago and Dallas reported slower sales in August as ""buyer fatigue"" set in. Several Districts mentioned dealers' concerns that current high sales would come at the cost of lower sales in the near future.  Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Richmond mentioned a shift in demand toward more fuel-efficient vehicles. A number of auto dealers indicated that inventories for new cars were low while stocks of used vehicles surged.  Tourism and Services   Tourism activity grew in most Districts. Atlanta, New York, Richmond, and San Francisco described tourism activity as strong, robust, or at high levels, while Kansas City and Minneapolis noted that activity increased from last year. Richmond noted that tourism in Washington, D.C., has recovered from September 11, 2001, and was on pace for a record year. The Chicago District reported that tourism in Michigan increased faster than expected, while Minneapolis observed that tourism in Michigan's Upper Peninsula was flat from last year. Several Districts noted that bookings were up and that activity was expected to increase for the remainder of the season. Contacts in other service businesses also noted growth in activity. Dallas and New York noted increased demand for temporary staffing services. Trucking and shipping businesses in the Cleveland and Dallas Districts reported an increase in activity; however, freight volumes slowed in the Chicago District. Meanwhile, railroad traffic in the Dallas District was generally up, with decreases in chemical, car, and appliance volumes. Sales for software and information technology services in Boston were generally up.  Manufacturing   Manufacturing activity increased in all Districts except Boston and St. Louis, where activity was mixed. New orders and production were up over a year ago. Nearly all Districts noted increased activity across a broad range of industry sectors. Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas reported strong production in construction-related products. San Francisco indicated strong demand for semiconductors and that orders increased at commercial aircraft and defense product firms. However, Atlanta and St. Louis reported that auto parts and motor vehicle industries experienced net declines in activity, and Boston reported declines in the textile industry. Rising material and energy costs were a common theme across most of the nation.  Real Estate and Construction   Residential real estate was strong, with signs of softening in some markets. Dallas, St. Louis, and San Francisco reported increased activity, with Kansas City, New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond all observing strong sales, but signs of cooling were evident. Atlanta reported sales above last year's levels in Florida, but demand was beginning to soften. Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and New York reported residential construction was still strong but down from last year, while St. Louis described it as lagging. Overall commercial markets grew. Most Districts described conditions as improving from weaker levels. Commercial real estate markets were strong in the New York and San Francisco Districts. Commercial construction activity increased in Cleveland, Dallas, Minneapolis, and St. Louis and was mostly flat in Boston, Philadelphia, and Chicago.  Agriculture Overall, agricultural conditions improved somewhat across most of the nation. Minneapolis reported generally strong conditions. Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and Kansas City reported that August rains lessened the impacts of drought. Highly variable crop yields were expected because of the drought damage that had already occurred. Meanwhile, Chicago, Dallas, Richmond, and San Francisco reported that agricultural producers were facing higher energy and other input costs. Prices for most agricultural commodities were solid; however, Kansas City reported some softening of cattle prices.   Natural Resources Industries   The energy and mining sectors remained generally strong. San Francisco reported energy operations were running at near full capacity. Dallas, Kansas City, and Minneapolis reported strong production, exploration, and capital investment in energy, with reports of service firms having difficulty keeping up with demand and rapidly growing backlogs.  Meanwhile, Atlanta reported that the approach of Hurricane Katrina had temporarily halted oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico. Mining activity was robust, as Minneapolis reported full production at mines and active interest in starting new operations.  Labor Markets  Several Districts reported signs of tightening in labor markets and some difficulty in finding workers for certain occupations. Atlanta, Dallas, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and San Francisco noted that labor markets tightened or improved, while demand for temporary employment was higher in Boston and Richmond. New York reported a step-up in hiring for the fall season.  In St. Louis, hiring in manufacturing was mixed, while service sector hiring was up. Hiring in the manufacturing sector was limited in the Cleveland District. Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Kansas City, and Richmond reported that some firms had difficulty finding qualified workers. Occupations mentioned include healthcare, accounting, information technology, trucking, energy, and construction-related trades.   Wages and Prices Wage increases were generally modest, but a number of Districts noted pressure on benefit costs, such as health insurance.  In the Kansas City, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts, wage pressure was described as up slightly, moderately, and modestly. Meanwhile, Dallas noted that pressure on salaries was growing, particularly for skilled workers, but that firms were resisting overall wage increases. Temporary firms in the Boston District noted concern about rising costs for unemployment and health insurance, while manufacturing and related services firms noted moderate wage and salary increases. In Kansas City, the percent of firms reporting wage pressures increased slightly from recent surveys. A contact in the Richmond District noted that companies were turning to temporary agencies to reduce costs of benefits and payroll administration. Except for energy, overall consumer price increases were modest. Most Districts reported significant price increases in certain commodities and energy products, especially gasoline. Higher energy costs were reported by almost all Districts, and energy-intensive industries were able to pass some of these costs on to consumers in the Atlanta, Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, and San Francisco Districts. Dallas and Richmond noted that most industries had difficulty passing increased energy costs on to consumers. In addition, several Districts reported significant increases in certain manufacturing and construction input prices, including steel, chemicals, plastics, and cement. Decreased lumber prices were noted in Dallas, Kansas City, and Minneapolis. Retailers and hotels increased prices in the Kansas City District.  Banking and Finance  Most Federal Reserve Districts reported increased lending activity. Districts reported strong demand for commercial and industrial loans and mixed activity for residential loans. Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported higher residential loan demand, while New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond saw decreased demand for residential loans, and St. Louis indicated mixed demand. Meanwhile, deposits were up in New York and steady in Kansas City.  Credit conditions remained at high levels in Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Richmond, and San Francisco and were unchanged in Dallas, Kansas City, New York, and St. Louis.",2005-09-07
29,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia based on information collected before October 11, 2005.  This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a representation of the views of Federal Reserve officials.   Economic activity continued to expand in September, according to information received by Federal Reserve District Banks.  Most Districts described the pace of activity as moderate or gradual.  Richmond reported some quickening in the pace of growth while New York reported a slowdown.  Atlanta reported mixed economic conditions, with significant negative effects on the District economy from hurricane damage. Dallas reported expansion overall but also experienced noticeable disruptions to the District economy as a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.   Retail sales of general merchandise increased in most Districts, but a number of Banks reported that retail sales were either below plan or weak.  Auto sales fell throughout the Districts.  Tourism activity was mixed.  Service sector activity continued to expand.  Manufacturing advanced in all Districts except St. Louis and Atlanta. Commercial real estate markets continued to firm up.  Residential real estate activity remained generally strong, but reports that demand for homes has eased have become somewhat more common.  Agricultural conditions were viewed as mostly good.  Mining and energy production increased except in the Gulf of Mexico, where damage to onshore and offshore oil and gas facilities is still being repaired.  Bank loans and deposits rose. Employment has been rising, and Federal Reserve Districts reported some tightening in labor markets.  Wage increases have been moderate, although a number of Districts noted increased upward pressure on wages and salaries in the service sectors and for some skilled occupations in several industries.  All Districts reported cost increases for energy, petroleum-based products, building materials, and shipping.  Several Districts indicated that input cost increases are being passed through to retail prices.  Consumer Spending Retail sales of general merchandise rose moderately in most of the Federal Reserve Districts in September, but other Districts reported some softness in the retail sector.  Sales increased in Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas.  Atlanta District retailers also had increased sales except in areas where hurricane damage forced stores to close.  Retailers in New York and St. Louis reported that sales in September had not met their plans, and retail sales in San Francisco were said to have weakened somewhat.  Retailers in many Districts noted that consumer confidence has ebbed as gasoline prices have risen. Auto sales fell in the Districts that received reports from auto dealers.  The drop came as manufacturers ended their discount programs.  Sales of light trucks and large sport utility vehicles were reported to have declined sharply.  However, within the generally slower sales environment, Atlanta and Dallas reported that sales of smaller, more fuel-efficient cars and hybrid vehicles were strong. Reports on tourism and leisure travel were mixed.  New York, Chicago, and San Francisco reported ongoing gains in tourism business and high rates of hotel occupancy.  Richmond and Minneapolis reported slower tourism activity, although Minneapolis indicated an increase in business travel was boosting hotel occupancy.  Tourism in Kansas City was said to be largely unchanged after a period of strong expansion.  Tourism activity declined in Richmond, and fell in Atlanta as a result of hurricane damage in New Orleans and along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Services Service activity expanded in almost all the Districts that reported on this sector.  Health-care services expanded in Boston, St. Louis, and San Francisco.  Professional and technical service business increased in Boston, Richmond, St. Louis, and Dallas.  Philadelphia reported gains in business services and information technology services.  Transportation activity was strong, according to New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco.  Atlanta gave a mixed report on transportation: demand for shipping was said to be strong, but damage to port facilities and railroads was severely limiting capacity.  Manufacturing Manufacturing activity rose in all Federal Reserve Districts except St. Louis, where manufacturers gave mixed reports, and Atlanta, where manufacturers along the Gulf Coast are still recovering from hurricane damage.  There were noticeable increases in demand for food products in Philadelphia, Dallas, and San Francisco, but St. Louis reported decreased demand at food processors there.  Increased demand for industrial equipment was noted by Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco.  Boston and St. Louis reported increased demand for pharmaceuticals.  Richmond's producers saw increased demand for chemicals and a variety of durable goods.  Cleveland and Kansas City also reported increased demand for durable goods generally.  Dallas and San Francisco cited increased demand for building materials, and Atlanta noted increased demand for manufactured housing as part of the rebuilding effort in hurricane-affected areas.  Producers of metals and metal products reported rising demand in Cleveland, Richmond, and Chicago, but they reported slower demand in Philadelphia and St. Louis.  Real Estate and Construction All the Districts reporting on commercial real estate conditions noted rising demand for office, retail, or industrial space.  Increased demand for commercial space was reported by New York, Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco.  Cleveland and Richmond cited growing construction of commercial buildings.  Atlanta reported a surge in demand for commercial space in areas where firms relocated after the hurricanes struck the Gulf Coast.  Chicago indicated that demand for commercial space was rising in many parts of the District, although not in downtown Chicago.  Office vacancy rates were declining in New York, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas.  San Francisco reported rising commercial rental rates.  Chicago indicated that rents rose in areas other than downtown Chicago.  Dallas reported that rents were holding firm but landlords were reducing incentives. District banks gave mixed reports on residential real estate markets.  Although levels of activity appeared to remain generally high, a number of Districts indicated that demand for housing was slowing in some regions.  Residential real estate activity continued to expand in Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas, and remained strong in San Francisco.  Richmond reported continued strength in housing construction, but indicated that demand was easing in some parts of the District.  Minneapolis reported that home sales had slowed in some areas but were strong in others.  Boston reported that homes were taking longer to sell, as did New York.  Cleveland reported little growth in residential construction.  Kansas City reported some easing in home sales and a growing inventory of houses for sale.  Chicago also reported higher inventories of unsold homes on the market.  Atlanta reported a strong increase in demand for housing in areas where evacuees from the coast were relocating, but indicated that demand for homes was moderating elsewhere in the District. Agriculture Agricultural conditions have been mostly good, but not uniformly so around the country.  Atlanta received mostly positive crop and livestock reports, although the storms damaged at least half of the Louisiana sugarcane crop.  Chicago reported that corn and soybean yields have been greater than expected.  Crop yields in Minneapolis were up for most crops.  Kansas City reported favorable harvest conditions and good progress in winter wheat planting.  Less positive reports came from St. Louis, where the rain brought by the hurricanes damaged corn, rice, and cotton crops.  Dallas reported that hot, dry weather in parts of the District has stressed crops, although cotton yields were high.  Richmond reported that hot, dry conditions were hindering fall planting of winter wheat, rye, oats, and barley.  Kansas City said that the transportation difficulties associated with the hurricanes hampered crop exports.  Chicago also reported that transportation of grains was disrupted, and farmers were unable to obtain adequate storage space;  As a result, crops were left in the fields or sold at lowered prices. Natural Resources Industries Districts reporting on the energy sector noted strong demand in the midst of supply constraints.  The limits on supply are a result of hurricane damage to oil and gas production and refining facilities along the Gulf Coast and to shortages of drilling equipment and oilfield workers elsewhere.  Atlanta reported that production in the Gulf remained severely disrupted, and that safety inspections and repair work continued. Kansas City saw an increase in the rig count, but indicated activity could have expanded further if more equipment and workers were available.  Dallas also reported increased activity, but noted that the loss of rigs in the Gulf had cut oil and gas production, and that damage to staging areas on the coast was retarding the repair effort.  San Francisco reported that producers of natural gas in that District were operating at or near full capacity.  Minneapolis reported that mining and energy activity was steady at a high level. Financial Services and Credit Lending rose in most Federal Reserve Districts in September.  Commercial and industrial lending advanced in Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco.  Commercial and industrial loan demand was reported to be steady in New York and St. Louis, but business borrowing slowed in Cleveland.  New York noted decreased demand for consumer loans and residential mortgages.  Chicago and Kansas City reported an easing in demand for residential mortgages, but St. Louis reported gains.  Dallas and San Francisco noted growth in lending in general.  St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas reported growth in deposits.  In the Atlanta District, small banks in areas devastated by the hurricanes are concerned that they will not retain their customer base if their market areas do not regain their resident populations.  Competition for loans was reported to be very intense in most regions. Employment and Wages Federal Reserve Districts reporting on employment noted tightening in labor market conditions.  Increased hiring was noted in a variety of industries.  Boston reported increased demand for professional and technical service workers.  New York cited stepped up hiring of office workers, especially in the financial industry.  Increased hiring in the financial sector was also reported by Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco.  Philadelphia and Cleveland noted that trucking firms in their Districts were having difficulty attracting and retaining drivers.  Dallas also indicated strong demand for truck drivers.  Chicago reported increases in hiring at firms in the software and telecommunications industry and among chemical companies, but noted layoffs among manufacturers of motor vehicles, paper products, and communications equipment.  St. Louis reported increased hiring in the lodging industry and the health care sector.  Minneapolis and San Francisco reported hiring in the mining industry, and Kansas City and Dallas reported increased hiring in the energy industry.  Richmond and Chicago noted an upturn in hiring at temporary staffing companies. Atlanta reported significant problems resulting from dislocation of workers caused by the hurricanes.  Temporary help agencies have been active in recruiting workers for disaster relief and cleanup operations.  In locations outside the areas damaged by the hurricanes, employment centers have been established, and job fairs have been held to assist displaced workers find jobs.  However, employers in the Dallas District have looked to evacuees to bring needed skills to the District labor pool. Most of the Districts reporting on wages said recent increases have been moderate, and Kansas City indicated that wage pressures have edged down.  However, Richmond noted that wages in the service sector have been increasing briskly, and San Francisco reported that wage pressures have risen noticeably for skilled workers in finance, construction, information technology, resource extraction, and health care.  Employers in the Philadelphia District said their benefit costs have been rising steeply.  San Francisco reported that employers there said their benefit costs have been rising faster than wages, but not as rapidly as in previous survey periods. Prices All Federal Reserve Districts reported a pickup in cost pressures from recent increases in the prices of energy, petroleum-based products, and shipping.  Reports of price increases for building materials, such as cement, sheetrock, and lumber, were also widespread.  These price increases have come largely in the wake of the recent hurricanes, as the supply of oil and natural gas has been disrupted and repair and rebuilding have increased the demand for construction materials.  Nevertheless, many business firms indicated to the District Banks that they expect high prices for energy and construction materials to persist.  In addition, New York and Kansas City reported a general escalation of costs for manufacturing inputs. While a number of Districts noted increases in prices of final goods, others continued to report that those prices remain relatively stable.  Chicago cited price increases for pharmaceuticals and air travel.  In Richmond and Atlanta, retailers and other business firms reported passing their cost increases through into their selling prices, and in Philadelphia and Dallas, large numbers of business firms said they have raised, or plan to raise their prices.  However, San Francisco reported that prices of final goods have remained stable, and Boston and Chicago said that the ability of businesses in their Districts to raise prices downstream was limited.",2005-10-19
30,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and based on information collected before November 21, 2005.  This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.  Economic activity continued to expand from mid-October through mid-November, according to reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Banks.  Manufacturing and services activity continued to increase in most Districts.  Retail sales increased in most Districts, but many Banks reported only modest year-over-year gains.  Auto sales softened in a number of Districts in October.  Generally, residential real estate market activity remained high, but many Districts reported a slowing or cooling of activity; many Districts also noted strengthening activity in commercial real estate markets.  Residential mortgage lending slowed in several Districts.  Hiring activity increased in many Districts, and some Banks noted a slight tightening in labor markets.  Most Districts reported persistent input price pressures and concerns about high energy prices.  Consumer price pressures increased moderately in some Districts, with mixed reports on firms' ability to pass through input prices to consumers.  Agricultural conditions were generally positive. Consumer Spending The reports on retail sales in most Districts were generally positive.  Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco noted an improvement since their previous report, while Chicago noted that sales continued to increase modestly in October and early November.  Dallas noted good sales growth.  In contrast, Richmond reported that sales growth had tapered off since their previous report.  Compared with a year ago, sales were flat or up in Atlanta, mostly up in Kansas City, and only modestly up in New York.  St. Louis reported a slight decrease in sales growth compared with last year; Boston, Philadelphia, and Cleveland reported somewhat mixed sales growth.  Several Districts reported that luxury items, electronics, and food were strong sellers, while winter apparel was a weak seller.  Of those Districts reporting on inventories, most reported that inventories were generally at satisfactory levels; Philadelphia noted that some contacts implemented price cuts earlier than usual to stimulate holiday shopping.  Several Districts reported that contacts were generally optimistic about the holiday shopping season.  Contacts in Boston, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas were at least cautiously optimistic about the upcoming months, and contacts in Philadelphia, Atlanta, and St. Louis generally expected at least a moderate increase in sales over the 2004 holiday season.  Some contacts in Boston and Kansas City, however, expressed concerns about the effect of high energy prices on consumer spending in the upcoming season. Many Districts reported declines in auto sales.  Atlanta and St. Louis both reported year-over-year decreases.  Cleveland noted that auto sales declined further in October after a sharp decline in September; Richmond reported recent auto sales that were substantially weaker than in their previous report, and Kansas City reported declines in late October and early November.  Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco noted that recent sales were slow, while Philadelphia reported increased sales in November after a decline in October.  Some Districts cited a lack of new incentive programs or the ending of pricing discounts as one reason for the declines.  Several Districts noted that the shift from larger autos and sport utility vehicles toward more fuel-efficient vehicles continued.  Additionally, Dallas and San Francisco noted a strong demand for foreign vehicles and soft or lower sales of domestic brands. Manufacturing and Other Business Activity Manufacturing activity increased in all Federal Reserve Districts except St. Louis, where activity was mixed.  Atlanta reported improving conditions, as several facilities came back on line and post-hurricane demand remained strong in several industries.  Philadelphia, Richmond, and San Francisco noted significant increases in activity among food manufacturers. In contrast, Dallas reported scattered softness in the demand for food products.  Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas reported strong demand for construction-related products.  Steel producers reported strong demand in both the Chicago and Cleveland Districts.  Chicago also saw strong orders for its tool and heavy truck industries.  Manufacturing activity in the Dallas District rebounded from mid-October to mid-November, with ongoing recovery of the facilities that shut down after the hurricanes.  While Philadelphia reported moderate overall growth in demand, business weakened in November for makers of apparel, paper products, and industrial materials and equipment.  Boston and Richmond reported significant declines in the furniture industry.  Several Districts with largely positive reports nonetheless expressed concern over rising material and energy costs. Most Districts reported increased activity in the services sector.  Strong demand for freight transportation continued in the Atlanta, Cleveland, and Dallas Districts; St. Louis reported that firms in this industry announced plans to expand operations.  Tourism increased in most Districts, including Chicago, New York, and Richmond.  Contacts in the Atlanta District's tourism industry were generally upbeat in October and early November, and San Francisco noted that activity in the sector remained robust.  Many Districts also noted solid growth in the financial, health care, software, and information technology sectors. Real Estate and Construction Residential real estate activity was reported to have moderated in many Districts.  Home sales were reported as slowing in the Philadelphia, Richmond, and Cleveland Districts.  The Minneapolis District noted that, for the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area, existing homes were on the market longer, inventories were rising, and price appreciation had slowed.  Although home sales remained fairly strong in New York City, the New York District reported that overall sales of homes in New Jersey had slowed and inventories were high.  Both the Chicago and Atlanta Districts reported flat home sales, and excess inventories were reported in the Kansas City District, though home sales there were up slightly.  Elsewhere, the St. Louis and Dallas Districts reported that home sales were strong in most metro areas, and San Francisco noted that home sales continued at rapid rates throughout the District, although cooling was evident in some markets, particularly Southern California.  Single-family permits were up in many areas within the St. Louis District and residential construction was strong in the Dallas District.  However, the pace of residential construction moderated in the Atlanta District, and homebuilders reported an expected slowing in the Philadelphia District; homebuilders also reported rising price of inputs in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Richmond Districts, as well as difficulties in obtaining some materials in the Kansas City District. Commercial real estate markets strengthened in many Districts.  Atlanta, San Francisco, Philadelphia, and Kansas City reported that demand for commercial real estate has continued to improve.  Boston, however, reported that commercial real estate in the Boston area remains flat.  Office vacancy rates in most areas of the St. Louis and San Francisco Districts fell and demand for office space picked up in the Philadelphia, Dallas, and Kansas City Districts.  Commercial agents expect continued improvement in the office market for the Kansas City District.  The New York District reported that lower and midtown Manhattan's office markets continued to strengthen, while most suburban markets slackened moderately.  Industrial vacancy rates fell in much of the St. Louis District, and contacts reported that demand for industrial space was on the rise in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts.  Commercial construction has improved in the Chicago District, while commercial construction was generally flat in the Richmond District.  The St. Louis District reported that commercial construction remains active. Banking and Finance Overall lending activity varied throughout the Federal Reserve Districts.  Lending activity slowed in Richmond and Chicago, and declined more notably in New York, while St. Louis and Dallas experienced little change.  Loan demand in Atlanta remained strong and it edged up in Kansas City.  Residential mortgage demand eased in the New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts, and in some areas of the San Francisco District.  Cleveland, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco reported good credit quality.  Atlanta and Dallas reported surges in personal bankruptcies ahead of the law change in October, although contacts noted that the increase was anticipated and should only be temporary. Agriculture Several Districts reported ideal weather for fieldwork and harvesting crops.  Reports on crop yields and production were mostly positive throughout the Districts.  In particular, Chicago expected larger corn and soybean harvests this year than any prior year except 2004.  Minneapolis reported record yields in Minnesota for corn and soybeans and that total corn and soybean production in the District was larger than in 2004.  Kansas City reported large harvests, San Francisco reported generally good conditions, Richmond noted good yields for soybeans, and Dallas reported that cotton yields were better than expected.  Atlanta reported that Hurricane Wilma had caused an estimated $1.5 billion loss to Florida crop production, and San Francisco noted that potato yields were low.  Many Districts reported lower farm incomes or profit margins this year--some attributed the declines to higher energy costs and lower product prices--but Kansas City reported strong incomes for livestock and crop producers.  Chicago reported shortages of rail, barge, and trucking capacity, while Richmond reported that limited grain elevator capacity had caused delays in harvest in some areas. Natural Resource Industries Districts reporting on the energy sector generally saw growth since their previous report.  Atlanta reported that production in the Gulf of Mexico had improved since September; however, nearly 40 percent of natural gas and half of oil production still remained off-line.  Most of the petroleum refining capacity in Louisiana and Mississippi was back on-line, but natural gas processing remains a concern as repair of processing facilities is taking longer than expected.  Dallas reported that capacity is aggressively being added in some lines of the oil service industry, and that approximately 200 rigs are currently under construction.  In the Kansas City District, the number of active oil and gas drilling rigs increased and was well above 2004 levels, although most contacts reported that drilling was being constrained by shortages in rigs, equipment, and workers.  Minneapolis reported that the District's level of oil and gas production has remained steady since early August and that, except for a mine in western Montana, most mines were operating near to their full capacity. Labor Markets Several Districts noted increased hiring in a variety of industries.  Dallas and New York reported increased hiring for professional and some types of skilled workers.  Chicago, Boston, and New York reported increased demand for office workers.  Dallas reported new hiring and concerns about shortages of skilled workers in the energy industry.  St. Louis reported plans of increased hiring in the freight transportation industry.  New York and Kansas City reported increased hiring in the manufacturing sector, whereas Cleveland and Boston reported manufacturing hiring as modest or unchanged.  Cleveland reported modest hiring in the retail sector, and Richmond indicated that retail hiring continued to contract.  Chicago reported employment increases in a wide range of sectors, with the exception of the auto industry, where several small suppliers reported reduced employment and two automakers announced plans for plant shutdowns and job cuts.  Several Districts reported signs of tightening in labor markets and some difficulty in finding workers for certain occupations.  Dallas and Cleveland reported that trucking firms were having difficulty attracting and retaining drivers.  San Francisco reported tight labor market conditions for workers with specialized skills in the financial, construction, and health-care services sectors.  Atlanta reported labor shortages in storm-damaged areas, especially in the construction industry. Wages District reports indicated modest overall upward pressures on wages.  Contacts in the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts reported moderate increases in wage pressures.  The Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts indicated more substantial upward pressure on wages in one or more particular industries.  The Dallas District provided the only indication of lower wage pressures--for the airline industry. Prices Consumer prices remained stable or experienced generally modest increases, but most Districts reported increasing input prices, particularly of energy-related products, construction and raw materials, and transportation.  Fuel surcharges have become common in many Districts.  In response to higher input prices, some businesses in the New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond Districts were able to pass along a portion of increased costs to consumers.  Retail prices in the Boston District remained stable but had risen modestly in the Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts.  Competitive pressures in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts have limited the ability to increase selling prices.  Some manufacturers in the Dallas and Minneapolis Districts, however, plan to raise prices in 2006.",2005-11-30
31,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and based on information collected before January 9, 2006.  This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.  Economic expansion continued across the twelve Federal Reserve Districts through the last several weeks of 2005.  Six--New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City--characterized their economies as expanding moderately or modestly.  Activity accelerated or increased at a solid pace in the San Francisco, Richmond, Atlanta, and Dallas Districts.  Boston characterized activity as continuing to expand, while Cleveland reported that conditions remained reasonably strong. Most Districts reported moderate increases in employment.  Labor markets tightened in some areas and for some occupations, but on the whole, wage increases were characterized as moderate.  Contacts reported that input-price pressures have continued for many items, particularly early in the supply chain, but they were less intense at year-end than earlier.  Retail prices and producers' prices for more finished goods, however, were widely reported as rising only moderately or remaining stable. Retail sales rose in most Districts, and those Districts that reported on travel and tourism spending said it was generally strong.  Increases in manufacturing activity were widely reported.  Most Districts indicated some cooling in residential real estate activity, while many noted that commercial real estate activity generally continued to improve.  Consumer borrowing was flat or fell in most Districts, while commercial borrowing was more mixed, with many Districts reporting moderate increases in activity.  Conditions in the energy sector seemed strong, while agricultural activity was mixed.  Prices Several Districts (San Francisco, Kansas City, Chicago, Richmond, Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Boston) reported that increases in energy prices moderated, or actually fell, albeit from high levels.  In the San Francisco, Cleveland, and Richmond Districts, these developments were thought to be associated with a wider easing in overall price pressures.  However, in the remaining nine Districts, nonlabor-input-cost increases continued to concern companies, particularly those in the manufacturing sector.  Producers were reported to have attempted to recoup these costs, although, according to the Atlanta, Boston, San Francisco, and Dallas Districts, intense competition was thought to be holding down price increases in parts of the supply chain further ""downstream.""  Increases in the prices of construction materials were widely reported. Retail prices were generally regarded as stable, though there was some significant discounting reported in the Cleveland and Atlanta Districts during the holiday selling season. More moderate discounting was reported in the Dallas District, levels about the same as last year were reported in the San Francisco District, and no widespread discounting was reported in the Philadelphia District.  Price increases are planned in the months ahead by a large share of retailers, according to the Kansas City District. Employment and Wages Most Districts reported signs of continued, if generally moderate, increases in employment.  Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Richmond all cited moderate employment gains, with Richmond noting that its rate represented a slowdown.  New York, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas reported evidence of stronger employment growth. However, Boston noted that output growth had generally not translated into higher employment, while St. Louis reported a widely mixed pattern of layoffs and hiring.  Hiring at financial and legal services firms is boosting the New York District's employment growth, although New York also reported some hiring in manufacturing.  Atlanta reported strong demand for both skilled and unskilled labor, in part boosted by storm-recovery efforts. Atlanta reported several locations with tight labor market conditions, while Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco all reported specific occupations in which jobs have been difficult to fill.  Several of these Districts cited trucking jobs. Skilled construction workers are relatively sought after in Dallas and San Francisco, and skilled manufacturing jobs were mentioned by Boston, Chicago, and Dallas. Atlanta listed a variety of specialties in ""extreme shortage."" New York and San Francisco noted that finance-industry labor markets were relatively tight.  Despite reports of labor market tightness, Boston, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco all noted that wage increases have been generally moderate.  However, New York, Chicago, and Dallas all reported some acceleration in compensation. Consumer Spending All Districts reported that their retail sales rose during this latest holiday selling season except Cleveland, where sales were generally flat or less than at this time a year ago.  Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City reported modest to moderate increases.  Boston, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco reported stronger holiday sales than these Districts.  The Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts noted significant increases in gift card sales, which led retailers in Richmond and Dallas to anticipate stronger sales and profits in early 2006.  Most merchants appear to have carefully controlled their inventories, which are generally at desired levels. Automobile sales were generally somewhat sluggish across the nation.  Dealers fared best in the Richmond, San Francisco, and Dallas Districts, where sales improved from low levels.  Sales trends were somewhat more mixed in the Chicago and Atlanta Districts.  Atlanta and Philadelphia reported that sales remained strong for foreign brands, even as demand waned for domestic ones, sales of which were reportedly not helped much by manufacturers' promotions.  Philadelphia and Kansas City characterized truck and SUV sales as especially slow. Travel and Tourism Travel and tourism remained robust across most of the country.  The San Francisco District reported that travel and tourism spending in Hawaii toward the end of the year occurred at a record-setting pace.  Elsewhere, ski resorts throughout the Kansas City and Minnesota Districts have done well this winter, though a few areas have suffered from a lack of snow.  In the Southeast, the Atlanta and Richmond Districts also reported robust activity, some of which was thought to be the result of unusually warm weather.  Tourist activity appeared to be recovering somewhat in hurricane-affected areas.  Finally, in the Northeast, travel and tourism remained strong. Manufacturing  Increases in manufacturing activity were widely reported across the country.  Only the St. Louis District characterized industrial activity as mixed.  Elsewhere, robust expansion was reported in the San Francisco, Dallas, Kansas City, Minnesota, Chicago, New York, and Boston Districts.  More moderate expansion was indicated in the Cleveland, Richmond, Philadelphia, and Atlanta Districts. Production of high-technology goods was steady to slightly increasing toward the end of 2005, according to the San Francisco and Dallas Districts.  And defense and aerospace industry production improved in the San Francisco, Boston, and Atlanta Districts.  Manufacturers of machine tools and industrial equipment also reported more robust demand in the San Francisco, Chicago, and Philadelphia Districts.  Production of construction-related materials and equipment expanded noticeably in the San Francisco, Dallas, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts but was characterized as slightly less strong in the Boston District.  Primary metals producers reported strong demand in the Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas Districts.  Producers of plastics and petrochemicals noted some slowing in demand in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts, though this was from fairly high levels.  By contrast, reports from the Richmond and St. Louis Districts suggested some improvement in the sector.  And weakness in the textile industry was reported in the Boston, Richmond, and Atlanta Districts. In the transportation equipment sector, reports from the Boston, Philadelphia, and Atlanta Districts suggested weakness among automakers and their suppliers.  However, in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts, activity appeared to be somewhat stronger.  Heavy truck production was also characterized as improving in the Chicago District.  Conditions in the transportation equipment sector were more mixed in the St. Louis District. Trucking and Shipping Trucking and shipping demand remained strong across the country, but companies were constrained by continuing driver shortages in the Atlanta, Cleveland, Chicago, and Philadelphia Districts.  In addition, despite the ongoing use of fuel surcharges, contacts in Cleveland, Dallas, and Atlanta noted that margins tightened because of fuel-cost increases.  Cleveland and Dallas reported plans for increased capital spending in the trucking industry.  Dallas also reported that both railroads and airlines saw rising demand. Construction and Real Estate Many Districts reported moderation in residential real estate activity, although from a high level.  Boston, New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Minneapolis reported some cooling in real estate markets.  While some of the hottest markets in the San Francisco District have cooled--for example, Southern California and the San Francisco Bay Area--other areas, such as Oregon and especially Hawaii, have reportedly heated up further.  Kansas City and Dallas continued to see strong housing markets.  And construction and repair work remained brisk in Louisiana and Mississippi. Conditions in Districts' commercial real estate markets generally continued to improve.  Vacancy rates fell in the San Francisco, Minneapolis, New York, Dallas, Richmond, and Kansas City Districts.  Chicago reported a more mixed picture, with some areas of the District expanding but activity in the city of Chicago flat.  Largely because of lower vacancy rates, rents rose in San Francisco and New York, while previous concessions were reduced or eliminated in Dallas.  New construction activity was reported to be increasing in the San Francisco, Minneapolis, St. Louis, Atlanta, and Cleveland Districts, and many contacts expect this trend to continue in 2006. Banking and Finance The Cleveland, Kansas City, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and St. Louis Districts saw moderate increases in commercial lending activity, while Chicago and Richmond reported that activity had slowed and Atlanta reported that activity was mixed.  Consumer lending was flat or fell slightly in the Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, New York, Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts.  The Philadelphia District was an exception, noting gains in consumer and residential real estate loans, but contacts noted that they expected lending for residential real estate to experience modest declines in the future.  In the Dallas District, deposit growth was strong, while Cleveland, Kansas City, and St. Louis reported modest increases in total deposits.  New York reported that conditions in the securities industry remained robust, with employees receiving significant increases in bonuses this year. Energy and Natural Resources  Conditions in the energy sector were characterized as strong or stable at a high level by four of the five Districts reporting on natural resources.  As a result, San Francisco, Dallas, and Kansas City all reported shortages of labor, materials, and equipment among energy-related enterprises.  Producers of natural gas and oil reportedly operated near 100 percent capacity in the San Francisco District, while the Atlanta and Dallas Districts reported that facilities in the Gulf of Mexico continued to recover from hurricane-related damage.  Minneapolis reported that most mining operations in its District were running near capacity. Agriculture Dallas, Kansas City, St. Louis, and Chicago all reported that low levels of precipitation were affecting crops and have the potential to lower yields in the spring, while Richmond reported that cold weather and abundant precipitation slowed harvesting activity in November and December. Citrus producers in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts reported a boost in profits from an increase in prices in the wake of substantial hurricane damage to the citrus crop in Florida.  Livestock reports were mixed, with San Francisco reporting increases in sales, Chicago reporting rising cattle prices and stable hog prices, and Dallas and Kansas City reporting reductions or anticipated reductions in herd sizes.",2006-01-18
32,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and based on information collected before March 6, 2006. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.  Economic activity continued to expand in January and February, according to reports from the twelve Federal Reserve District Banks. Most Districts characterized the pace of expansion as moderate or steady. San Francisco said that the ""solid expansion remained on track,"" and Dallas indicated that activity strengthened. In contrast, the pace of growth moderated in the Richmond District, and Philadelphia said activity expanded at a slow pace. Nationwide, consumer spending continued to expand. Capital spending increased at a similar pace as in the previous reporting period, and expenditures for business services continued to rise. Employment continued to increase in most locations and in many sectors of the economy. Most Districts said that residential construction and real estate activity slowed from high levels, while commercial markets were generally more active than at the end of 2005. Reports indicated that manufacturing continued to expand during the first two months of the year. Household lending softened, while commercial and industrial lending expanded at a modest pace. Contacts noted ongoing input cost pressures, but prices at the retail level increased at only a moderate rate. Labor cost pressures were little changed. Natural resource activity was very solid overall. Agricultural conditions remained mixed, and a continued lack of moisture generated concern in several Districts. Consumer Spending and Tourism Consumer spending continued to expand. Many Districts reported that retail sales showed solid gains during January, which retailers frequently said were spurred in part by unseasonably warm weather and holiday gift card redemptions. Without the added boost from those factors, retail sales during February softened in the New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas regions. However, sales in the Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts apparently maintained much of their momentum. Retail inventories were generally at desired levels across the country. Light vehicle sales in many areas were described as ""sluggish"" or ""unusually slow,"" although Philadelphia and Atlanta noted some improvement in sales between January and February. Vehicle inventories were generally above desired levels. The majority of reports on tourism were positive. Sales were up over last year at winter-sports destinations in the Richmond, Minneapolis, and Kansas City regions; however, ski resorts in New England and New Mexico were suffering from a lack of snowfall. Warm-weather destinations in the Atlanta and San Francisco Districts reported a brisk pace of activity. Atlanta also noted that tourism in the Gulf Coast region was being re-established slowly, though several casinos experienced larger-than-expected increases in revenues. Business Spending and Hiring Most reports indicated that capital spending increased at a similar pace as in the previous reporting period. There were some exceptions. Manufacturers in Philadelphia reported a pickup in the pace of investment, and firms related to the heavy equipment industry said that they were budgeting large expansions in capital outlays. In contrast, manufacturers in Atlanta had modest near-term spending plans, and those in Kansas City indicated that they were slowing the rate of increase in their capital spending. In the San Francisco District, the implementation of productivity-enhancing technologies has allowed banks to maintain profit margins and helped producers in the agricultural and resource sectors maintain output levels in the face of input constraints. Expenditures for most business services continued to rise. Several Districts noted strong revenue gains for insurance, accounting, telecommunications, and health care firms. Boston said that information technology services firms reported strong revenue growth and expectations for steady or faster growth in the next six months. Demand for trucking and rail shipping services remained robust in Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas; two of those Districts observed tight capacity conditions. Air travel was strong in many parts of the country. Employment continued to increase in most locations and in many sectors of the economy. Atlanta said labor markets were firm, and Minneapolis saw signs of tightening. Cleveland said job openings had increased but hiring remained sluggish. Kansas City indicated that layoff notices outnumbered hiring announcements. Retail employment was steady in recent weeks, according to Boston, Richmond, and Chicago. New York observed a pickup in manufacturing hiring, but factory employment was steady or showed more limited increases in other regions. Three Districts reported an expansion in service jobs. Demand for temporary workers was strong in most areas, although several staffing firms in the Boston region said that revenues have been lower than expected recently. Almost every District reported shortages of high-skilled workers. Construction and Real Estate Construction and real estate activity was mixed by market segment and location. Most Districts said that residential activity slowed from high levels. Homebuilders in many Districts indicated that new home sales were trending down, but contacts in the Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas regions said that demand for new homes had improved relative to the end of 2005. Half of the Districts reported that the number of homes for sale had increased. Home price appreciation slowed in many areas, and real estate agents in the Richmond region said that fewer homesellers were receiving multiple offers. Several developers in the Atlanta District reported putting condominium projects on hold because of soft pre-sales or rising construction costs. In contrast, commercial construction and real estate markets were generally more active than at the end of 2005. Philadelphia reported that the completion of a number of office projects this year would boost the space on the market; Minneapolis noted a number of new development projects; and San Francisco said that building activity had picked up for commercial projects and public structures. Chicago and Richmond indicated that overall commercial vacancy rates were stable. Office vacancy rates fell in the Boston, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco regions, but were mixed in New York. Industrial vacancy rates fell in three Districts, and Philadelphia said that demand for factory space had increased. Manufacturing District reports indicated that manufacturing activity continued to expand during January and February. Atlanta and Dallas said that activity picked up, and New York noted continued improvement in conditions, while Kansas City and San Francisco suggested that the pace of expansion had slowed; the remaining Districts indicated that manufacturing conditions were similar to those at the end of 2005. Manufacturers in Boston and Philadelphia generally expected the expansion in activity to continue in the coming months, and factories in Cleveland anticipated a pickup.  In most Districts, the strength in demand for factory goods was widespread across industries. The sectors frequently mentioned as facing strong demand included construction materials, electrical equipment, defense products, tractor trailers, heavy trucks, and heavy machinery. Cleveland reported that steel shipments held steady or increased, and Chicago said that steel production remained strong. Conditions in other metals industries were mixed, as Philadelphia and Chicago reported strong growth in demand, Dallas noted little change, and San Francisco characterized demand as ""tepid."" Most regions had some weak performing industries, but few were consistently mentioned as underperforming. Several Districts commented on the ongoing struggles of the domestic nameplates in the auto industry. An automaker in the Chicago region reported that slowing sales and high inventories would likely restrain production in the coming months, and automakers in Cleveland noted large declines in output compared to year-ago levels. Atlanta mentioned that many suppliers to the domestic nameplates have seen slower demand, and Kansas City added that a number of partsmakers had ceased production. Dallas noted that a narrowing spread between refined fuel and crude prices led some refineries to briefly reduce production in February. Some refineries in the Gulf Coast region reportedly will have longer maintenance turnaround times this spring because repairs were postponed in the aftermath of the hurricanes last fall. Banking and Finance Household lending activity softened, while commercial and industrial lending expanded at a modest pace. Reports on mortgage demand ranged from slowing growth in Richmond, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco to declining activity in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Kansas City. Other types of consumer borrowing were typically characterized as ""mixed"" or ""weak."" Interest rates on household loans increased in most Districts.  Business lending increased at a slow pace in the Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco regions, while it was unchanged in the New York and St. Louis Districts. Bankers in Philadelphia expected growth in commercial and industrial lending, although several indicated that they were limiting real estate development and construction loans. Interest rates on commercial loans increased, according to New York, Richmond, and Kansas City. Comments about household and business credit quality were mostly favorable. Delinquencies were unchanged in New York and remained low in Atlanta, though a banker in the Chicago region said that there was a noticeable rise in delinquencies and foreclosures in parts of Michigan dominated by the auto industry. Deposit growth was generally steady, and several Districts indicated that interest rates on deposits had increased. Lending was very competitive, which squeezed margins for many banks. Nonetheless, no District reported a change in lending standards. Prices and Employment Costs Contacts generally reported ongoing input cost pressures, while prices at the retail level increased at only a moderate rate. Philadelphia observed a steady rate of increase in input costs, and Chicago said that cost pressures remained firm. Cleveland said that cost pressures were less pronounced than in the previous reporting period, but Richmond said that the prices of most intermediate goods and services were increasing at a somewhat faster pace. San Francisco saw little or no change in modest inflation pressures. At the retail level, Kansas City said price pressures edged up, but Atlanta saw only moderate price increases for non-energy consumer prices, and New York noted little broad-based acceleration in consumer prices. Elevated energy costs were mentioned frequently. Fuel surcharges remained in place in many locations. Contacts in Atlanta felt that a high degree of uncertainty in the energy markets would cause many firms to leave surcharges in place for the indefinite future, but some large companies in the Chicago region obtained a few reductions. The costs of many non-petroleum materials--including asphalt, cement, gypsum, lumber, copper, and paper--were on the rise, though steel prices stabilized in most places. Airfares and hotel room rates continued to increase. Labor cost pressures were little changed. Most Districts reported that wages increased modestly on average. The only exception was Philadelphia, which reported that many of its contacts expected a faster rate of increase in average salaries and wages compared with 2005, as firms stepped up counteroffers to workers who were planning to change jobs. A shortage of qualified workers for skilled positions in finance, construction, and manufacturing industries resulted in more rapid increases in pay for those workers. Energy and Natural Resources Natural resource activity was very solid overall. Energy extraction improved in the Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco regions and remained at a high level in Minneapolis. Most of these Districts reported that output was constrained by shortages of labor, parts, and equipment. Oil and natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico remained in a slow recovery from last year's hurricanes. Mining activity increased in the Minneapolis District, where several mines were running at or near full capacity. Agriculture Agricultural conditions varied across the nation. Unseasonably mild weather boosted output in the San Francisco District and aided field preparations in Richmond and Chicago. Moisture conditions improved in much of the Minneapolis region, but a continued lack of moisture affected farmers and ranchers in the Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. The drought concerns limited cattle herd expansion, and some banking contacts in the Dallas region said that they may not finance certain farming operations unless moisture conditions improved. Prices for agricultural products remained generally stable or increased, though poultry prices declined. Agricultural input costs were still high, which limited purchases of fertilizers, chemicals, and machinery.",2006-03-15
33,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and based on information collected on or before April 17, 2006.  This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.  Reports from all twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that economic activity continued to expand in March and the first half of April.  Three Districts--Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco--characterize growth as ""solid,"" while a number of others describe the rate of economic activity as ""modest,"" ""moderate,"" or ""steady.""  Richmond notes a quicker pace of growth, and Dallas indicates that activity continued to strengthen. By contrast, New York says the rate of growth may have slipped a bit since the last report.     Most Districts report that orders or revenues in the manufacturing sector continue to come in ahead of year-earlier levels, although New York notes some deceleration in manufacturing activity, and Atlanta says that manufacturers' results were mixed.  Non-auto retail sales are up from a year ago, as well, according to most Districts, although the shift of Easter from March last year to April this year makes comparisons difficult.  Activity levels in service industries--including temporary help, health services, professional and technical services, and transportation and shipping--are also expanding according to District reports.  The pace of housing market activity is said to be moderating in many Districts, while commercial activity is firming.  A majority of Districts note that labor markets, at least for skilled workers, are tight or are tightening.  While energy costs are high and costs for selected other inputs are rising, businesses continue to have limited ability to raise their selling prices.      Consumer Spending and Tourism  The majority of Districts cite improving retail sales overall, but Richmond and Cleveland experienced sluggish or disappointing results.  Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco all report modest to solid gains, although year-over-year comparisons have been complicated by Easter's shift from March in 2005 to April in 2006.  Several Districts report strong sales in home and garden products and building goods.  Reports on apparel and grocers are mixed.  Retail inventories were generally at desired levels across the country.   Auto sales were mixed across the Districts.  Many Districts report that sales were short of year-ago levels, but Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Kansas City, and Minneapolis all indicate that sales improved from the prior survey period.  While demand in San Francisco was stronger than expected, Boston, Atlanta, and Dallas all cite flat sales.  Many Districts continue to say that sales of imports and used cars are stronger than new domestic vehicles.     Most of the reports on travel and tourism are positive.  Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco all cite modest to strong improvements, and while New York saw tourism softening slightly, it was still at high levels.  In contrast, tourism was mixed in Richmond.  Ski resorts in the Boston District continued to suffer from lack of snowfall, but tourism was thriving in the Boston metro area.  A record-setting ski season was reported in Virginia, and Minneapolis saw a positive ski season in parts of the District.    Services Industries  All Districts reporting on nonfinancial services note increased activity during the first quarter relative to a year ago.  Health-care services expanded in the Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts.  Professional and technical services activity increased according to Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, and Dallas, while San Francisco notes mixed conditions in information technology services.     Temporary employment firms in the New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts report modest demand growth in the first and early second quarters. A large New York employment agency found increased demand for legal and financial services employees, while Dallas contacts noted increased demand for temporary workers in high-tech and light industrial manufacturing.    Transportation services activity improved this quarter, according to reports from the Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts.  Trucking and shipping respondents from the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and St. Louis Districts report increased growth relative to a year ago.  While Cleveland's contacts continue to express concern about fuel costs, many now believe that they can increase their base rates, given the strength of demand.   Manufacturing  Reports on manufacturing activity remain positive.  Districts describe shipments and orders as continuing to strengthen--significantly in some cases and gradually or steadily in others.  Only Atlanta characterizes overall manufacturing activity as mixed, although New York indicates a retrenchment in orders and shipments in early April followed a strong March.  All Districts mentioning near-term forecasts say that, on balance, manufacturers expect business to remain on an upward trajectory.   Multiple Districts note strong or expanding production of steel, construction inputs, machine tools, aircraft equipment, and food.  Production capacity for mining equipment in the Chicago District is reportedly booked through 2007.  Chicago described heavy- and medium-duty truck orders as remaining solid, but light vehicle sales as flat, with some signs of excess auto inventories.  Other District updates on auto assembly and parts production were mixed--some up and others down. Trends in apparel-making also varied, with Richmond and Dallas citing increases but Atlanta, St. Louis, and San Francisco indicating shutdowns or disappointments.     Although several Districts describe labor demand in the manufacturing sector as mixed, most report some form of pickup.  For example, Richmond says that ""factory employment grew modestly,"" Cleveland notes more hiring on the part of durable goods producers, and Boston indicates that most manufacturers were hiring in order to obtain a ""higher skill mix.""  District reports on capital spending tend to be either modestly positive or mixed.   Real Estate and Construction  Most Districts report cooling and moderation in their residential real estate markets. In general, year-on-year price appreciation seems to be lower than in quarters past, with San Francisco, Cleveland, Kansas City, Richmond, New York, and Boston all reporting more modest price growth in residential sales. Several Districts' contacts noted that slower price increases were a healthy market outcome. Residential inventories are increasing; Kansas City, Minneapolis, Chicago, Atlanta, New York and Boston all saw increases in residential inventories compared with the first quarter of last year. The Dallas District, by contrast, registered particularly strong residential sales.    Residential construction is more regionally differentiated than overall residential sales and prices. In the West, Dallas and San Francisco both cite high levels of residential construction activity, with Dallas homebuilders reaching record sales for the first quarter of 2006. In the Midwest, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and St. Louis report declining residential construction. As well, the Chicago District mentions slower residential building in most areas. In the South, Atlanta indicates that single family construction remained strong but that some condominium projects have been postponed or cancelled.   The commercial real estate outlook appears to be predominantly positive across the reporting Districts--none report weakening commercial demand. San Francisco, Dallas, Minneapolis, St. Louis, Atlanta, and New York all register strong commercial activity. Kansas City, Chicago, and Richmond report steady to improving levels of activity. With vacancies declining in many locations, rents appear to be edging upwards.   In the West and the Midwest, commercial construction appears to be responding to increased commercial demand. Dallas, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Chicago, and St. Louis all report increasing or soon-to-be increasing commercial construction. San Francisco cites continued high levels of construction activity. In the South, Richmond reports little change in new construction, while overall development in Atlanta remained at low levels. The New York District featured relatively stable commercial construction.   Banking and Finance  Reports of lending activity are mixed, as most Districts reporting on financial services continue to see decreases in demand for consumer loans and residential mortgages, coupled with moderate expansion of commercial and industrial lending.  St. Louis and Kansas City, in particular, saw a decrease in consumer lending, while both Chicago and Kansas City witnessed decreased demand for home equity loans.  Almost all Districts report declining demand for residential mortgages.  Meanwhile, commercial and industrial lending increased in nearly all Districts, with only St. Louis reporting a decline.  Bankers in Richmond noted that commercial lending for mergers and acquisitions and construction remained high.  Respondents in San Francisco mentioned an increase in venture capital financing.    While reports of credit quality are positive across the board, delinquency reports are more varied, with low delinquency rates in Atlanta, commercial and industrial delinquency rates increasing slightly in New York, home mortgage delinquency rates increasing somewhat in Dallas, and respondents in Philadelphia predicting a possible future increase in delinquencies due to rising interest rates on adjustable-rate mortgages.  Deposit growth was steady in Cleveland and Kansas City, sluggish in Chicago, and flat in Dallas.  Philadelphia, Dallas, and San Francisco all report fierce competition for loans and narrow net interest margins.  However, credit standards remained virtually unchanged in all Districts except for New York, where standards tightened slightly for consumer loans.   Agriculture and Natural Resources  Adverse weather conditions and high energy costs are affecting agricultural prospects in much of the country. Although recent rains have brought some relief, dry weather has reportedly stressed pastureland and crops in the Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. By contrast, unusually wet weather has delayed fieldwork in the San Francisco District.  Ranchers facing poor pasturage in Kansas City and Dallas are culling their herds and giving supplemental feed unusually early; as a result, Kansas City reports downward pressure on prices for feedlot cattle. In San Francisco, prices received by ranchers have softened but remain at a high level. St. Louis and Minneapolis report that one-half to two-thirds of the winter wheat crop is in good to excellent condition, but the Kansas City crop is described as poor, and Dallas reports that half the District wheat crop will be lost. Reflecting relative crop prices and the high cost of fertilizer, Chicago and St. Louis farmers are said to be shifting acreage from corn to soybeans. Contacts in Dallas and San Francisco also note the high cost of fertilizer and fuel, while Chicago and Dallas indicate that these costs are combining with dry conditions to cause cash flow problems for farmers.    In the energy sector, demand for oil and natural gas or oil services remains robust and energy activity continues to expand, according to contacts in the Dallas, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. Minneapolis reports that energy activity is stable at a high level. Dallas and Kansas City indicate that the count of active oil and gas rigs continues to rise. In the Gulf of Mexico, Dallas notes that the rig count is close to pre-Katrina levels, while Atlanta reports that the share of oil and gas still ""shut in"" amounted to just 23 percent for oil and 14 percent for natural gas in early April. Dallas, Kansas City, and San Francisco contacts see little or no excess capacity in the energy sector. In particular, Kansas City contacts say that shortages of equipment and workers are constraining drilling activity; pipeline capacity is also limited in some areas.  In the Minneapolis District, almost all open mines are producing near capacity.   Prices and Wages  High energy prices were at the forefront of most Districts' mentions of cost pressures.  Manufacturers in most Districts cite rising costs for other inputs, with metals mentioned most frequently along with petroleum-related products.  While no District reports that cost increases have intensified in the latest survey period, Kansas City says that firms were having greater difficulty obtaining steel and aluminum.  Services firms are also reported to be facing higher costs, notably for utilities, shipping, and transportation. Many Districts describe firms as attempting to raise selling prices but having mixed success, with price increases generally either smaller than the cost increases or less widespread.  Richmond, Cleveland, and Chicago, for example, mention manufacturing firms' limited ability to recoup higher costs; Boston and Dallas say competitive pressures are constraining some price increases, and Atlanta notes that the ability to pass on cost increases varies across firms, depending in part on the strength of demand and contract arrangements.  Construction materials costs have also risen, or supplies are tight, according to reports from Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas.   A number of Districts, including Cleveland, Richmond, and Dallas, cite high energy prices as an explanation for weaker than expected tourism results, auto sales, or retail sales, especially to lower-income consumers, with the impact occurring both directly by constraining consumers' driving and indirectly by reducing the income available for purchases after paying for home fuel and transportation fuel.  Atlanta and Chicago note the possibility of such energy cost impacts as a risk to the summer outlook.   District reports from Boston, New York, Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas say that labor markets are tightening, especially for skilled positions.  Philadelphia, Minneapolis, San Francisco, and Atlanta indicate that labor markets remain tight in at least some parts of their Districts.  Contacts in Atlanta, Richmond, Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas state that truck drivers are in short supply.  Wages continue to move up, but only a few Districts--New York, Dallas, and Kansas City--mention a pickup in the pace of raises, while Philadelphia cites firms more often paying in the high end of salary ranges.  Richmond reports no pickup, but a continuation of ""brisk"" wage increases in services. Boston says manufacturing wage increases are in the same range as last year, Chicago cites a steady pace of labor cost increases, and Cleveland notes no reports of accumulating wage pressure, while Minneapolis and San Francisco mention moderate overall wage increases.",2006-04-26
34,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and based on information collected on or before June 5, 2006. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.  Reports from all twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that economic activity    continued to expand from mid-April to early June, but there were some signs    of deceleration. Activity moderated in four Districts--Atlanta, Kansas City,    Richmond, and San Francisco--and the New York District noted increased concern    about the outlook for the second half. Seven Districts--Boston, Chicago, Cleveland,    Dallas, Minneapolis, New York, and St. Louis--said growth was similar to the    pace reported in the last Beige Book. The Philadelphia District, however, reported    an improvement in overall economic conditions.   Consumer spending continued to increase, but District reports suggest that    the growth rate slowed. Manufacturing activity still expanded quite strongly,    but reports indicate more areas of weakness than in March and early April. Residential    real estate markets continued to cool across the country, with slower homebuilding    and sales of existing homes. In contrast, commercial real estate activity strengthened,    and a few reports expressed concern about too much building in some portions    of the real estate market. Activity in service-producing industries was strong    or increased in all Districts that reported on that sector. The financial sector    continues to report good credit quality. Commercial lending picked up, but there    was some slowing in loans to consumers, particularly for mortgages and home    equity loans. Growth in the energy industry continued to be robust, with expansion    constrained by shortages of equipment and labor. Agricultural conditions varied    across the country.  Labor markets continued to tighten, with more Districts reporting employers    having difficulty finding skilled workers. Wage pressures remained moderate    overall, with the exception being workers with hotly demanded skills. High energy    costs were fueling price increases in manufacturing and, to a much lesser extent,    retail. Reports of costs being passed forward varied considerably but were more    prevalent than in the last Beige Book.  Consumer Spending Consumer spending continued to increase between mid-April and early    June, but reports were varied, and several Districts noted areas of weakness.    Some Districts mentioned that sales were slowing or weaker than anticipated    at discount stores or to lower income customers. High gasoline prices were cited    by a few Districts as changing purchasing patterns or clouding the outlook for    sales. A couple of Districts also said that rising interest rates were a concern.    Inventories were mostly reported to be at desirable levels, but the Atlanta,    Boston, and Kansas City Districts said some retailers had more inventory than    they would like.   Two Districts reported weaker retail sales growth--Dallas and Richmond--and    retail sales were ""down"" compared with last year in the St. Louis District.    The Boston and New York Districts said results were ""mixed,"" but Boston added    that the majority of retailers cited soft year-over-year sales gains. Three    Districts--Kansas City, Minneapolis and San Francisco--reported little change    in retail sales. Philadelphia said sales in its District increased from April    to May, but gains were ""varied"" among stores. The Atlanta District reported    that sales rose at a ""solid pace"" but ""some segments reported lower demand.""    Improving trends were reported by the Cleveland District, and the Chicago District    said consumer spending continued to ""increase modestly.""   Most reports about auto sales suggested weakness, with particularly poor sales    of SUVs and light trucks. Auto sales were reported as ""sluggish"" or ""down"" in    the Chicago, Cleveland, St. Louis, and Philadelphia Districts. Atlanta reported    that sales were ""mixed,"" and Kansas City said auto sales were unchanged from    last month but lower than a year ago. Sales increased in the Dallas and San    Francisco Districts, but some dealers in the Dallas District reported sizable    excess inventory because sales were less than expected over the winter months.    The Chicago and St. Louis Districts also reported that inventories were higher    than desired, and the Philadelphia District said dealers had limited their orders    to manufacturers to keep inventories in check. The Kansas City District reported    that inventory levels were satisfactory.  Manufacturing   The manufacturing sector continued to expand quite strongly, but with more reports    of softening than at the time of the last Beige Book survey. Strong activity    was noted in the production of goods to supply the energy, semiconductor, and    aerospace industries. Areas of weakness included production of agricultural    equipment and autos. Slower demand for goods to supply residential building,    most notably lumber, was mentioned by a few Districts, although the Atlanta    and Dallas Districts reported demand for construction-related materials still    remained strong overall.   Manufacturing activity was characterized as ""strong"" or ""up solidly"" in the    Boston, Chicago, Dallas, and Kansas City Districts. The San Francisco District    reported that activity expanded overall, with production of commercial aircraft    near full capacity and capacity utilization of semiconductor manufacturers at    or above 90 percent. Production was ""steady to increasing"" in the Cleveland    District, and firms continued to report generally favorable conditions in the    New York District. Activity continued to expand in the Minneapolis and St. Louis    Districts. Two Districts--Philadelphia and Richmond--noted some softening or    leveling of growth. The Atlanta District said activity remained mixed.  Services   The Boston, Dallas, New York, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts report    ""strong"" or ""robust"" activity throughout the service-producing sector. Demand    for workers at temporary employment firms picked up in the Chicago, Dallas,    and Richmond Districts, while contacts in the Boston, Dallas, and New York Districts    indicated ""steady"" and ""solid"" activity. Business activity at information technology    service firms grew at a steady pace in the Boston and San Francisco Districts,    and firms in both Districts indicated an increase in hiring activity. Demand    for health-care and professional services was vigorous in the San Francisco    District, while demand for professional services in the Dallas District was    ""typical.""   Demand for trucking, shipping, and rail services remained strong across the    country, but companies cited difficulty finding and retaining drivers in the    Atlanta and Cleveland Districts. The Boston, Chicago, and Dallas Districts indicated    strong demand for air travel.   Reports from the tourism and hospitality industries remained upbeat. Tourism    activity strengthened in the Boston, Minneapolis, New York, and Richmond Districts    and remained solid in the Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts.    The Chicago District reported steady tourist activity but noted that pre-bookings    were slow. Hotel occupancies were strong in parts of the Atlanta, New York,    Richmond, and San Francisco Districts, and the Atlanta District reported that    gambling revenues were recovering.  Construction and Real Estate   Residential real estate markets continued to cool across much of the country--with    most Districts reporting slower homebuilding and sales of existing homes. In    contrast, commercial real estate activity continued to strengthen in most Districts.    A few reports noted concern about too much building.  Some softening of the market for existing homes was reported by ten Districts--Chicago,    Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, New York, Richmond,    St. Louis, and San Francisco. Dallas and Richmond noted that activity remained    quite strong, and Chicago reported slowing from high levels. San Francisco reports    hot housing markets in Utah and parts of the Pacific Northwest. Several Districts    said sales had weakened for some of the most expensive homes, except in the    Dallas District where demand for lower-priced homes ""had dipped noticeably.""    Atlanta reported that residential sales were near year-ago levels in most parts    of the District, but that sales weakened and inventories increased in Florida.    The Philadelphia District said sales of homes in resort areas have declined    sharply. The New York District reports a sharp deceleration in prices in the    suburbs around New York City, but a tightening of the Manhattan rental markets.  Homebuilding slowed in most Districts--Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas    City, New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and San Francisco. The New York District    reported that some homebuilders in New Jersey are withdrawing from the authorization    process and allowing their options to build to expire, noting that increases    in fuel and materials costs are pinching profits. Homebuilders in the Atlanta    District reported that single-family home construction was near year-ago levels    in most parts of the District, except in Florida, where sales slowed. The Atlanta    District also reported that Florida condominium sales continued to weaken and    several projects were cancelled.   Commercial real estate activity strengthened in nearly all Districts, with    mostly positive reports about office markets. Commercial building ""improved""    in the Cleveland District. Office markets were steady or stronger in the New    York City metro area, with scattered signs of accelerating rents. The Philadelphia    District said vacancy rates have continued to decline in the region's office    markets. The Richmond District reported ""fairly strong"" office markets. Demand    for office space ""edged up at a steady pace"" in the Dallas District. Office    vacancy rates fell and rental rates rose in most major markets in the San Francisco    District.  Boston reported that downtown office real estate markets were improving but    mostly at the expense of suburban markets. Demand for commercial real estate    in the Chicago District continued to expand, but the pace of new commercial    construction slowed, according to contacts, who said rents were too low to justify    new construction.   The Kansas City District reported that commercial construction remained strong,    but received a few reports that high material costs were resulting in the scaling    down or postponement of some projects. Construction firms in the Philadelphia    District reported that rising costs have caused some construction projects to    be rebid or redesigned to reduce the amount of costly materials used. Some builders    in the San Francisco District continued to face cost increases and minor project    delays as a result of tight availability of skilled workers and selected materials,    such as steel and cement.  The Philadelphia District reported growing demand for industrial space and    an increase in construction of industrial buildings both on a speculative and    build-to-suit basis. Demand for industrial properties was said to be gradually    improving in the Dallas District. The Richmond District also reported growth    in commercial leasing in the industrial sector.  Contacts in the Boston, Chicago, and Dallas Districts expressed concern about    the level of investment in some portions of the real estate market. The Boston    District reported that New England--and Boston in particular--continues to attract    large volumes of commercial real estate investment, resulting in price increases    that require ""ambitious assumptions"" to justify the transaction. The Dallas    District noted growing concern about overbuilding of condominiums and town homes    in Dallas, and contacts ""fear that it will end badly."" A contact in the Chicago    District expressed concern about the potential for overbuilding of large distribution    centers in Indiana.  Banking and Finance   Overall lending activity was mixed, and credit quality remained good across    the nation. The New York, Chicago, and Atlanta Districts reported continued    slowing in loan demand, while lending activity levels held steady in the Dallas,    Kansas City, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts. Only the Philadelphia District    noted an increase in overall loan volumes over the past six weeks.  Demand for commercial loans increased or remained steady in most Districts,    with only the Atlanta and Chicago Districts reporting a slowing in commercial    lending activity. Bankers in the Dallas, and Richmond Districts said loan pricing    was very competitive, and contacts in the Richmond District said they had to    reduce margins to retain market share. On the consumer side, most Districts    reported softening mortgage finance activity, while reports of other types of    consumer loans were mixed. Demand for home equity loans weakened in the Chicago    and Kansas City Districts but was up in the Cleveland and Philadelphia Districts.    Refinance activity was categorized as ""brisk"" in the San Francisco District    but declined in the Chicago, Kansas City, and New York Districts. Slower auto    lending was reported by the Atlanta and Cleveland Districts.   Deposit growth was mostly steady, and some Districts noted an increase in    interest rates on deposits. Delinquencies declined in the Chicago and New York    Districts, but bankers in the Philadelphia District expect rising default rates    if interest rates continue to rise. The Kansas City and St. Louis Districts    reported no change in lending standards, while the New York District reported    an easing in credit standards, especially for consumer loans.  Agriculture and Natural Resources   Agricultural conditions varied across the country. Spring rains boosted moisture    conditions in parts of the Dallas and Minneapolis Districts, and most crops    were off to a good start in the Chicago, Richmond, and St Louis Districts. Plantings    were ahead of last year's pace in the Minneapolis, Richmond, and St Louis Districts,    while crop conditions improved in the Atlanta District. In contrast, a dry spell    lowered winter wheat crop yields and was hurting cattle producers in parts of    the Dallas and Kansas City Districts. Concerns about high fuel and fertilizer    costs were reported by contacts in the Kansas City District as well as the Minneapolis    District, where agricultural lenders anticipated a decline in farm income in    the second quarter.   The energy industry continued to show strong and expanding oil and gas activity    in the five Districts that mention the sector--Atlanta, Dallas, Kansas City,    Minneapolis, and San Francisco. The Dallas and Kansas City Districts noted that    drilling activity is being constrained by shortages of equipment and labor.    Expansion of coal-fired power plants, wind farms, and ethanol distilleries was    reported as under way in the Minneapolis District. The Kansas City District    also reported that a railway expansion is in progress that will allow more coal    to be moved out of Wyoming's Powder River Basin to end users.  The Kansas City and Minneapolis Districts reported that overall mining activity    is strong, with all open mines in the Minneapolis District producing at or near    capacity.   Labor Markets   Labor markets continued to tighten across the country. Shortages of some types    of skilled workers were reported by nine Districts--Atlanta, Boston, Chicago,    Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City, Philadelphia, Richmond, and San Francisco. Six    of those Districts noted that the shortages had intensified--Atlanta, Boston,    Cleveland, Dallas, Philadelphia, and Richmond. District reports mention a variety    of skills that are in short supply, including truck drivers, some types of engineers,    financial analysts, and oil and gas workers. The Minneapolis and New York Districts    noted strengthening labor markets. In contrast, manufacturers in the Richmond    District reported that hiring softened after several months of moderate payroll    increases.  Salaries continued to rise, but wage pressures were reported to have intensified    somewhat in only a few Districts--Dallas, Kansas City, and Philadelphia. The    San Francisco District said wage growth remained rapid for selected worker groups    with specialized skills. The Cleveland District reported an absence of any accumulating    wage pressure outside of a few specific skills. Pay rates were not accelerating    in the Boston or Chicago Districts.  The Atlanta District reported that shortages of affordable housing were hampering    labor availability in South Florida and the Gulf Coast region.   Prices   Concerns about high or rising costs were expressed by business contacts across    much of the country. Cost pressures were pushing up selling prices for manufacturers    in several Districts, but few reports indicated that these increases were reaching    the retail level. Four Districts--Boston, Cleveland, Dallas, and New York--cited    rising selling prices for manufacturers, and just three Districts--Boston, Dallas,    and Philadelphia--reported that retailers are having success raising retail    prices.  Cost pressures increased in the Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas,    Kansas City, New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco Districts. Some firms    in the Philadelphia District said their suppliers were including automatic price    escalation in contracts to cover future increases in the cost of materials.    The San Francisco District noted little or no change from the modest upward    pressure on prices noted in the previous report. Only the Richmond District    reported that raw materials prices increased less rapidly than in the last report.  Higher prices were reported for a number of items, with the products most    cited including fuels, metals, petroleum-based products, and many building materials,    such as concrete, steel, copper, and zinc. The most notable price decline was    for natural gas. A number of Districts reported increases in fuel surcharges.    In the New York District, fuel surcharges were being added with relatively little    resistance from customers. Increases in delivery charges were noted by firms    in all industries in the Philadelphia District. The Cleveland District reports    that rising freight costs were affecting retailers.  Retailers in the Philadelphia District said they have raised retail prices    significantly for some goods with large plastic or metal content, although they    had not implemented major price increases for most lines of merchandise. Several    retailers in the Dallas District said that they had passed cost increases through    to higher selling prices. Retailers in the Boston District indicated that vendor    prices continued to reflect increases for petroleum-related items, and many    contacts reported being able to pass on some price increases to consumers. The    Atlanta District reported that firms' ability to pass on higher costs to customers    remained mixed, citing slowing demand and strong competition restraining price    increases. Five Districts--Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, New York, and San    Francisco--reported little change in retail prices since the previous reporting    period. The Richmond District reported that retail price growth eased slightly    in May.",2006-06-14
35,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco based on information collected on or before July 17, 2006.  This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve System and is not a representation of the views of Federal Reserve officials.  Reports from all twelve Federal Reserve Districts generally indicated continued economic growth during June through mid-July, with numerous individual reports pointing to evidence that the pace of growth has slowed.  Several Districts characterized the overall pace of economic growth as ""moderate"" or ""modest,"" although San Francisco reported that its economic expansion remained ""solid"" and Atlanta and St. Louis described overall conditions as ""mixed.""  The Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco reports each highlighted a decline in the overall rate of economic growth in their Districts. Most reports on retail sales indicated slightly weaker conditions, on balance, than earlier in the year.  But tourist spending remained robust, albeit with evidence of slower growth in some areas, and activity expanded for providers of nonfinancial services to businesses and consumers.  Reports from the manufacturing sector were strong, with significant gains in output and sales, especially for durable goods.  Producers in the agricultural and natural-resource sectors also saw strong demand, although some weather-related difficulties and other supply constraints were noted.  Activity in residential real estate markets cooled in most parts of the country, but various Districts reported an ongoing pickup in demand for commercial space.  Among financial institutions, lending activity mirrored developments in the economy more generally:  commercial and industrial lending expanded further, while most Districts reported a decline in residential mortgage lending and some noted reduced demand for consumer loans. Increases in wages and in prices of final goods and services remained modest on net.  Upward pressure from the elevated prices of energy and other inputs persisted; while this pressure increased further in some cases, a few Districts noted a moderation in prices for some items.  Scattered reports from various Districts indicated an increase in manufacturers' and retailers' ability to pass such cost increases on to final prices.  More generally, however, Districts reported that vigorous competition held price increases down, and some contacts noted reliance on productivity increases to maintain profit margins in the face of rising input costs.  Labor markets tightened a bit further in most areas.  Increases in base wages and salaries generally remained moderate, but they were relatively rapid for workers with specialized skills in a wide range of sectors. Consumer Spending and Tourism Many reports indicated that consumer spending on retail goods weakened slightly during the survey period.  Although most Districts reported gains in retail sales compared with a year earlier, they generally characterized the pace of growth as modest or disappointing.  Retail sales were ""mixed"" or ""varied"" in Boston, New York, and Atlanta, ""flat"" in Richmond, ""cooling"" in Dallas, and ""below expectations"" in Chicago and San Francisco.  Most Districts reported that sales gains for department stores and smaller retail establishments were limited or below retailers' expectations.  Sales were healthy for luxury retailers but relatively weak among ""big box"" retailers and other low-price outlets.  Cleveland and Chicago reported that general retail spending was held down in part by high gas prices, which have squeezed households' budgets and reduced the frequency of shopping trips.  In general, sales of automobiles and light trucks were flat to down.  Sales remained healthier for imported vehicles than for domestic makes despite the revival of sales incentives for the latter, as high gas prices continued to nudge buyers towards fuel-efficient models.  Inventories reportedly were undesirably high for SUVs and light trucks in some areas. Activity in the travel and tourism sector generally remained at high levels or increased further, although a few reports indicated that the pace of growth has slowed.  New York noted that occupancy rates in Manhattan recently edged down from very high levels.  Performance was mixed in Richmond's tourism sector, and Kansas City and Minneapolis reported that summer tourism activity has been at or only slightly above year-earlier levels.  Atlanta reported ""cautious optimism"" in the tourist trade and increased tourist traffic to Florida destinations, while San Francisco reported that tourist activity increased further from very high levels in Hawaii and other destinations throughout the West. Nonfinancial Services Activity in the nonfinancial services sectors generally expanded further, although the pace of growth reportedly slowed in the Philadelphia and Richmond Districts.  Providers of business and professional services, such as advertising, accounting, management consulting, and technology services, saw solid demand in general and increased activity in the Boston, Richmond, and San Francisco Districts.  Providers of permanent and temporary employee placement services were quite active, with modest or better increases in hiring reported in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and Dallas Districts.  Reports on the health-care sector were mixed, with ""brisk"" activity reported by San Francisco but Richmond noting that activity was ""flat to lower.""  Reports on the transportation sector suggested further increases in activity on net.  Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, and Dallas pointed to recent expansion in rail freight and trucking activity, and San Francisco reported strong demand for transportation services.  By contrast, Cleveland and Chicago noted slight declines in trucking tonnage and rail tonnage, respectively, with the latter attributed to reduced shipments of construction materials. Manufacturing Reports on manufacturing activity indicated significant gains across most Districts during June and July.  The only slightly weak reports came from New York, where manufacturers reported decelerating activity in July in the wake of a strong June, and St. Louis, where manufacturing conditions were mixed. Among products, demand was especially vigorous for various durable goods.  Substantial sales gains were reported for makers of electrical equipment and information technology products such as semiconductors, along with further increases in orders and activity for makers of commercial aircraft and products used for national defense.  The reports also pointed to a further rise in demand for makers of heavy equipment, machine tools, and steel, offset in part by reduced demand for smaller equipment that is oriented towards residential construction activity.  Demand for building materials was mixed but generally positive.  Atlanta reported a drop in demand for concrete, but Chicago reported strong demand for wallboard, and Richmond and Minneapolis noted further increases in the production of fabricated metals.  Among nondurable products, the reports indicated strong demand and further growth for chemicals, plastics, textiles, and processed food. The Cleveland, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts noted that capacity utilization was high in various manufacturing sectors and increased a bit further in general.  Looking ahead, manufacturers in the Boston, Philadelphia, and Cleveland Districts reported plans to increase their capital spending over the balance of the year, but in the Kansas City District expectations for future capital spending remained low. Real Estate and Construction With only scattered exceptions, Districts reported slower activity in residential real estate markets.  For new and existing homes, available reports indicated that the pace of sales declined and that the inventory of available homes and time on the market rose in most major metropolitan areas nationwide.  Slower sales activity has translated into more limited price gains, and residential construction activity has fallen in most Districts as well.  The St. Louis and Dallas Districts were exceptions to the general slowdown in residential market activity.  In the St. Louis District, the pace of home sales was largely unchanged or up slightly compared with a year earlier, although residential construction slowed there.  Housing markets have remained resilient in the Dallas District, where despite signs of cooling, ""home demand remains strong"" and residential building activity has been ""robust.""  As home demand has slipped more generally, scattered reports indicated a strengthening in demand for rental units.  New York reported that the market for apartment rentals has been tightening in Manhattan, and according to Atlanta slower condominium sales in Florida have prompted owners to convert some units to rental property. Slower activity on the residential side was offset in part by firmer activity on the commercial side.  Demand for commercial space was strong in general, and the market tightened further in most Districts.  Commercial construction activity was at high levels and increased further in the Dallas, Atlanta, and Richmond Districts.  By contrast, Chicago reported a modest slowdown in commercial construction activity, and Kansas City noted that ""commercial real estate activity was mostly flat."" Builders in some areas faced moderate constraints on construction activity.  High construction costs reportedly were a restraining factor that delayed or caused the cancellation of some building projects in the Cleveland, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts.  Moreover, Atlanta reported that some commercial building projects along the Gulf Coast have been put on hold until late fall, after the current hurricane season is over. Banking and Finance Overall lending activity remained strong on net but growth slowed in most Districts, as continued strength in business loans was offset by further weakening in loans to households.  On the business side, commercial and industrial lending generally was at high levels and rose further in many Districts.  The main exceptions were Richmond, where rising interest rates reportedly contributed to a decline in commercial lending, and Atlanta, where commercial lending ""remained slow overall.""  Loans to households weakened somewhat in most Districts, as ongoing declines in mortgage lending were reinforced by slightly slower consumer lending in some areas.  Most Districts reported a reduction in the pace of mortgage lending, although St. Louis saw a slight increase.  While consumer lending was reported to be stable in a few Districts, it slowed somewhat in the St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts.  New York noted overall weakening in loan demand, with especially pronounced declines for consumer loans and mortgages for commercial real estate.  In most Districts, credit quality remained high across all loan categories. Agriculture and Natural Resources Reports indicated further expansion of demand for most agricultural and natural-resource products, but growing conditions for crops in some regions were hampered by dry weather.  Demand was strong for most crops and livestock products, and prices generally remained firm even for products in ample supply.  Dry conditions constrained growing in the Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and Atlanta Districts, holding yields on corn, cotton, and other crops below normal levels.  Dry conditions also caused pasture deterioration in the St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts, increasing operating costs for livestock producers and prompting some to reduce or liquidate herds.  By contrast, dry weather contributed to healthy crop conditions for corn, cotton, and other items in the St. Louis District.  High input prices reportedly squeezed agricultural profit margins in some areas, with Chicago noting an increase in farmers' reliance on operating loans and Kansas City reporting an expected drop in farm incomes this year. Activity was robust in the natural-resources sector.  Dallas, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Minneapolis reported further increases in extraction activities for oil and natural gas.  Demand for labor and equipment was strong, and some producers reported labor shortages and difficulties obtaining needed materials and equipment.  Producers of natural gas continued to operate at high levels, although Dallas and San Francisco reported that inventories have risen substantially, causing prices to decline. Prices and Wages Increases in prices of final goods and services generally remained modest, despite the pressures from high prices for selected inputs and further increases for some.   Manufacturers' and retailers' ability to pass cost increases on to final prices varied.  Providers of transportation services have been able to apply fuel surcharges, significantly increasing the price of their services in some areas over the past year.  In addition, Atlanta noted rising prices charged by various service providers, and Kansas City reported an increase in the percentage of manufacturers reporting higher prices on finished goods.  Other reports indicated more limited pricing power and smaller increases in final prices.  Richmond reported that retail prices rose at a slower pace in recent weeks, and Kansas City reported that recent and planned increases in retail prices were unchanged from the previous survey period.  Dallas noted that weaker demand of late reduced firms' ability to raise prices in some industries. District reports indicated that labor markets were tight in general and tightened a bit further in most areas.  Increases in base wages and salaries generally remained moderate overall, with scattered indications of faster growth for some workers.  San Francisco noted that numerical reports on wage increases generally were in the range of 3 to 4 percent.  In the Kansas City District, the fraction of firms reporting ""above-normal"" wage increases edged up, and Dallas reported significant pay increases for workers employed through temporary services firms. Wage increases remained relatively rapid for skilled workers in many areas, including managerial and professional employees and those with specialized occupational skills in a variety of industries.  Moreover, New York reported that the market for recent college graduates has tightened, with starting salaries up 7 percent over the past year in that city.",2006-07-26
36,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and based on information collected on or before August 28, 2006.  This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.    Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that economic activity continued to expand since the last report, but five Districts indicated deceleration while the remaining seven reported little change in the pace of growth.  Some slowing in economic growth was seen in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts, though Dallas still characterized growth as strong.  Most other Districts reported continued modest growth, though Atlanta described activity as ""mixed"", Richmond observed that growth was ""slow,"" while San Francisco noted a ""solid"" growth pace.    Consumer spending increased slowly in most Districts, weighed down by sluggish sales of vehicles and housing-related goods.  While a number of districts noted some bloating in automobile inventories, most non-auto retailers indicated satisfaction with inventory levels.  Tourism was generally characterized as steady but relatively strong.  Reports on the service sector varied by industry and by district: some found the trucking and information technology industries to be relatively strong, but others provided mixed reports on air transportation and health care.  Manufacturing activity continued to expand in all districts, despite pockets of weakness mostly related to autos and residential construction. Reports on real estate and construction were uniformly weak for the residential sector, but fairly widespread strength was recounted in the commercial sector.  Financial institutions reported some softening in loan demand, especially for home mortgages, but noted that credit quality was still favorable.  Drought-like conditions in much of the nation have hampered crop production and livestock while energy production remained at a high level. Labor markets were mostly described as steady since the last report, with scattered labor shortages and associated upward wage pressures noted in a number of Districts, especially for workers with specialized skills.  Widespread increases in the prices of energy and certain other commodities persisted since the last report, though most of these increases do not appear to have passed through to finished consumer goods.   Consumer Spending and Tourism Consumer spending increased modestly in most Districts since the last report, though a few Districts reported flat to declining sales.  In general, sales of autos and home-improvement and other home-related goods tended to be weaker than for other categories. A number of Districts also indicate that persistently high energy prices are perceived to have crimped consumer demand in general. Overall, retail sales were described as growing modestly in nine Districts: Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco.  The Richmond and St. Louis Districts noted weak or declining sales while Cleveland described sales as mixed.  Vehicle sales were reported to have weakened in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts; however, a pickup in auto sales was indicated in the Chicago District.  Vehicle sales were described as mixed in the Atlanta, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco Districts; all four noted a shift in demand toward more fuel-efficient vehicles.   Aside from automobiles, retail inventories were generally reported to be at favorable levels, where specified--in the Boston, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts.  Kansas City reported a slight decline in the share of store managers satisfied with inventory levels.  However, excessive vehicle inventories were reported in the Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts, and contacts in the Kansas City District anticipate a build-up of vehicle inventories in the months ahead.   Tourism was, on balance, little changed from the last report.  The New York, Atlanta and San Francisco Districts indicated continued high levels of tourism activity.  Activity was described as mixed in the Richmond and Chicago Districts and as weaker in the Minneapolis and Dallas Districts.     Services Activity in the service sector was mixed across Districts and across industries since the last report.  Regarding the broad service sector overall, Richmond reported an acceleration in service firms' revenues, St. Louis and San Francisco indicated steady growth while New York indicated some slowing in activity.  The transportation industry was mixed since the last report.  Strong or increased overall activity was reported in the Atlanta, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts; Richmond reported that airports' revenue accelerated.  In contrast, St. Louis and Dallas indicated some softening in the airline industry, and Cleveland noted some moderation in trucking and shipping activity.  Boston reported steady growth in business at software and IT service firms.  The Richmond and San Francisco Districts characterized the health care industry as robust, whereas the St. Louis District indicated impending layoffs in that industry.      Manufacturing Manufacturing activity was reported as generally expanding in all Districts, and contacts were optimistic that activity would continue to grow in the months ahead. While the pace of manufacturing activity had slowed in the New York, Richmond, and Kansas City Districts, it was reported as increasing in the Philadelphia and Chicago Districts.    Factory activity was reported as declining in some sectors but increasing in others. Several Districts reported a decline in activity in the motor vehicle industry, although Cleveland noted that some of this decline was likely seasonal; Chicago said that heavy-duty truck production and demand for heavy equipment continued to be strong. Steel demand also remained strong according to the Cleveland and Chicago Districts. Activity was reported as rising in aircraft and defense sectors.  Reports of slowing in activity related to residential construction and housing-related products were widespread, although demand related to non-residential construction activity was reported as improving. The production of apparel was also cited as having slowed. Energy-related manufacturing activity continued to rise strongly, and capital goods output was reported as generally growing in most Districts.  Real Estate and Construction Housing markets and home construction activity weakened throughout the nation, but commercial real estate and construction strengthened in most Districts.  Virtually all Districts reported declines in home sales, as well as in residential construction activity.  Moreover, most Districts indicated substantial increases in the inventory of unsold homes; Kansas City attributed some of this increase to ""sizable numbers of foreclosures"" in some areas.   In general, residential real estate contacts expected that housing markets would remain weak, if not weaken further, in the months ahead; such concerns were specified in the reports from Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City.   Relatively flat or declining home prices were noted in the New York, Richmond, and Kansas City Districts, and decelerating prices were reported in the Philadelphia and San Francisco Districts.  The high end of the market was described as particularly weak in the Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts, as well as parts of the Minneapolis District.  In contrast, the high ends of both the Dallas District's housing market and the New York District's co-op and condo market were reported to have experienced less softening than the more moderately priced segments.  One area of relative strength in residential real estate has been the apartment market--of the three Districts reporting on this, New York and Chicago both indicate fairly strong demand for apartment rentals since the last report, while Dallas noted continued strong demand for condominiums.  Commercial real estate markets were uniformly described as strong and, in most cases, increasingly so.  Office markets showed noticeable signs of improvement in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco Districts.  However, market conditions were described as mixed in the Richmond and St. Louis Districts.  The reports on markets for industrial space were not as uniformly positive: Philadelphia, Richmond, and Atlanta reported some firming, whereas Minneapolis noted some softening; industrial markets were described as generally steady in the New York and St. Louis Districts.  With widespread tightening in commercial real estate markets, most Districts also reported increases in commercial development and construction. Increased office construction was reported in the Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts.  Minneapolis also reported a pickup in industrial construction while Cleveland and Dallas reported increases in retail development. Public construction activity was described as strong in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts.  Banking and Finance Banks reported mixed but generally slowing trends in lending activity during the summer, with softening demand most evident in the household sector, especially for home mortgages.  The New York, Cleveland, Atlanta and Chicago Districts reported declines in overall loan demand, while the Philadelphia and Kansas City Districts reported increases.  However, reports of soft and/or weakening demand for residential mortgages were more widespread, as highlighted in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts.  Although refinancing was generally described as soft, both Richmond and Chicago noted an uptick in such activity, which was attributed to homeowners looking to lock in fixed rates.  Demand for commercial and industrial loans rose in the Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts but weakened in the New York and Kansas City Districts.    Overall credit quality was generally described as good, and delinquency rates were little changed in most Districts, though a few noted scattered increases.  The New York and Philadelphia Districts reported modest increases in delinquencies on home mortgages, and Cleveland noted a slight increase in the commercial segment.  Credit standards were reported to be steady to slightly tighter.   Agriculture and Natural Resources  Drought and near-drought conditions persisted throughout much of the country, depressing crop production and livestock sustainability. Conditions were distressed in the Atlanta, Richmond, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts.  Dallas reported that more than 50 percent of key crops were in poor shape, and the consequent acceleration of the liquidation of cattle is expected to cut beef supplies significantly over the next few years. Weather conditions improved somewhat in the Kansas City District; nonetheless, the region's crops continued to suffer from prior drought conditions, and cattle producers there also plan faster liquidation of herds.  St. Louis reported mixed conditions.  The bright spots were in the Chicago District, where above-average rains reduced stress and improved the crop outlook from earlier drought conditions, and in the San Francisco District, where conditions were reported as favorable.  The demand for oil and natural gas was reported as continuing to be robust, and facilities were operating near capacity. But several reports indicated some softening in natural gas prices. Drilling and exploration activity was reported as rising slightly, but constrained by capacity constraints, with the Dallas District noting that some drilling activity had shifted away from natural gas and toward oil.  Mining activity was reported as robust.  Labor Markets Labor markets around the nation have generally been steady since the last report.  Scattered labor shortages continued to be reported in a number of Districts, though these do not appear to have intensified, except in the Dallas District.  Job growth was described as brisk in the Kansas City District, and recent acceleration was noted in the Richmond District.  Labor markets were characterized as steady or expanding moderately in the other ten Districts.  The Kansas City and Dallas Districts reported fairly widespread labor shortages while more specific shortages were cited in a number of other Districts: Cleveland indicated a shortage of truck drivers, Atlanta noted ongoing shortages of construction and hospitality workers along the Gulf Coast (where Hurricane Katrina struck a year ago); Chicago reported shortages of skilled manufacturing workers and engineers; and Minneapolis mentioned some shortages in Michigan's northern peninsula.  Wage pressures were reported in a number of Districts, though they were most often limited to certain sectors and most pronounced for workers with specialized skills.  Overall increases in wage pressures were mentioned in the Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts.  A number of other Districts reported sharp wage increases or wage pressures for such workers in occupations that are in short supply or for workers in particular industries, such as information technology (Boston), trucking (Cleveland), retail trade (Chicago), and financial and health services (San Francisco).   Prices Reports of sustained increases in the cost of metals, energy and petroleum-based products, and other raw materials continued to be widespread, although increases in energy costs were reported as moderating in the San Francisco District.  Some Districts reported flat to declining prices for natural gas and a moderation in the price of steel.  Manufacturers found little ability to pass through higher costs into the prices of manufactured goods, with the exception of energy-intensive goods and services as reported by the San Francisco District. Many Districts reported lower prices for apparel and electronic goods, and most Districts reported that retail prices remained steady.",2006-09-06
37,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and based on information collected    before October 2, 2006. This document summarizes comments received from businesses    and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary of the    views of Federal Reserve officials.   Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that economic activity    continued to expand since the last report. Four Districts reported that economic    growth firmed while a couple of Districts noted that growth cooled. Other reports    generally characterized growth as moderate or mixed.  Consumer spending increased more quickly in a number of Districts, although    several reports continued to note that automobile and home-related sales were    sluggish. Tourism was generally strong and added some momentum in the New York    and Kansas City Districts. Activity in the service sector expanded in most Districts,    but Boston described activity as flat and Cleveland and Dallas identified pockets    of softness in some industries. Manufacturing conditions generally held up well,    with several Districts indicating that growth increased, though Philadelphia    reported that activity edged down. Commercial construction gained strength in    most of the country. Reports on residential real estate, however, indicated    widespread cooling with the majority of Districts citing lower asking prices,    rising inventories of homes on the market and softening sales. A number of reports,    however, indicated that residential activity increased in some markets. Financial    institutions continued to report that residential mortgage lending had tapered    off, but commercial lending activity picked up in several Districts. Agricultural    conditions generally improved as rainfall brought relief to drought-stricken    areas.  A number of Districts reported that labor markets were tight with some noting    shortages of skilled workers. Wage pressures were associated with tightening    conditions in a few Districts, though other reports noted that wage pressures    were in check. While the majority of Districts characterized price pressures    as contained, input prices increased in several Districts and a few reports    mentioned increased pass throughs by businesses.   Consumer Spending and Tourism   Most Districts reported stronger growth in consumer spending, although automobile    and housing-related sales generally weakened. Solid back-to-school sales helped    boost retail revenues in the Philadelphia, Atlanta and Minneapolis Districts.    Chicago said back-to-school sales were within expectations, though ""nothing    stellar."" Sales of upscale merchandise picked up in the New York District,    while apparel sales grew more quickly in the Boston, Cleveland and San Francisco    Districts. Chain department store sales were stronger in the Richmond District    and same-store sales increased in the New York District. Softer residential    real estate conditions damped home improvement and furniture sales in the New    York, Richmond, Kansas City and San Francisco Districts.   Vehicle sales weakened in several Districts--particularly sales of domestic    automobiles, SUVs and light trucks. However, a few Districts reported increased    sales of foreign cars and fuel-efficient automobiles. Philadelphia noted that    a growing number of smaller automobile dealerships had closed and dealers in    the Atlanta District added incentives to move inventory. In the Dallas District,    sales of luxury vehicles increased.  Tourist activity strengthened since our last report. New York said that tourism    remained robust in New York City. Kansas City reported solid gains in hotel    occupancy rates, while tourist activity in the San Francisco District remained    at a high level despite some moderation. Tourism in the Richmond District was    temporarily dented by Hurricane Ernesto in early September, but rebounded later    in the month.  Services   Activity in the service sector generally strengthened across Districts since    the last report. The Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis and San Francisco Districts    reported increased demand for professional and technical services. Boston reported    increased demand for consulting and financial services, and along with San Francisco,    for healthcare services. Richmond indicated that demand for computer and web-based    services firmed and San Francisco noted that demand for media services was stronger.    Assessments of transportation services were mixed. Trucking firms reported declining    volume in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta and Dallas Districts, and in    Cleveland, shipping services continued to soften. Chicago said trucking volume    was up slightly and cargo shipping increased in the Dallas District. St. Louis    reported that freight transportation companies planned expansions. Atlanta indicated    that rail companies experienced steady growth in inter-modal shipment volume,    and Dallas said that rail demand was strong.  Manufacturing   Manufacturing activity remained generally strong in most Districts. Eight of    the twelve Districts indicated that factory output increased, while Chicago    and Kansas City noted that the pace of expansion slowed. Minneapolis described    factory activity as mixed and Philadelphia reported that factory production    edged down. The output of energy-related equipment increased in the Boston,    Atlanta and Dallas Districts, while Chicago and San Francisco indicated that    orders for machine tools increased. San Francisco reported that semiconductor    sales were solid. The demand for steel was especially strong according to Atlanta    and Chicago, while Cleveland and Chicago noted that heavy equipment sales continued    to be robust. Chicago also reported strength in heavy-duty truck production.    In contrast, St. Louis said that producers of motor vehicle parts announced    plans to lay off workers and Cleveland reported weakness in the auto industry.    Reports of softer demand for housing-related products continued to be widespread,    but Dallas noted that strong demand from the commercial construction industry    helped offset softer residential demand. Cleveland, Minneapolis, Dallas and    San Francisco said that sales of food products had accelerated since our last    report.  Construction and Real Estate   Nearly all Districts reported that housing market conditions continued to soften,    though several noted that activity increased in some markets. Most Districts    reported higher home inventories, and several said that homebuilders and sellers    continued to offer incentives to attract buyers. Softer home demand in San Francisco    led to layoffs for mortgage brokers and real estate agents. Residential construction    remained weak in the St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts except in western North    Dakota where residential construction was described as ""robust."" New home inventories    inched up in the Dallas District despite strong demand in some of its markets    and inventories of single family homes and condominiums rose sharply in the    Boston District.   New York and St. Louis reported mixed housing activity. On the upside, Manhattan    condominium sales showed signs of resilience, and housing sales rose in Memphis,    but both Districts noted weakness in most markets. Richmond reported generally    weaker housing activity, but also noted increases in some markets. Atlanta said    that housing activity rose in its Mississippi Gulf market, and Minneapolis'    Sioux Falls market remained on pace with last year's record-breaking level.    Dallas reported particularly robust home sales in its Houston, Austin and El    Paso markets.   Commercial real estate markets were strong in most Districts, and activity    increased at a faster pace in a number. Leasing activity increased in New York,    Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco, and held steady in Richmond.    Chicago and St. Louis, however, said leasing activity was mixed. Rent increases    were reported by New York, Minneapolis and San Francisco, with Dallas indicating    that pricing power was shifting to landlords.  Nonresidential construction was generally strong. Construction activity was    steady in the Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts    and increased in the Chicago and Dallas Districts. Material costs and budget    concerns scaled back some projects in the Atlanta and Chicago Districts. The    Chicago and Minneapolis reports noted concerns among some contacts that commercial    construction may slow in the coming months.  Banking and Finance   Lending activity was mixed as increases in commercial lending were offset by    further weakness in residential mortgage lending. The New York, Richmond and    Chicago Districts reported declines in overall loan demand, while Philadelphia,    St. Louis and Kansas City reported modest increases. Demand for residential    mortgages slowed in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta,    Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco Districts. Demand for commercial and industrial    loans rose in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis    and San Francisco Districts; held steady in the Richmond and Dallas Districts;    and declined in the New York District. The commercial lending market was characterized    as very competitive by Richmond, Chicago and Dallas. Overall credit quality    remained generally good, although increases in mortgage delinquency rates were    noted by Philadelphia, Cleveland and Atlanta. Tighter standards for commercial    loans were reported by New York and Chicago.   Agriculture and Natural Resources   Agriculture conditions generally improved as late summer rainfall brought relief    to drought-stricken Districts, although some rains hindered field work in some    areas and damaged crops in others. Richmond indicated that tropical storm Ernesto    severely damaged crops along some coastal areas. Chicago and St. Louis reported    that recent precipitation and unseasonably cool weather delayed corn and soybean    harvests. Crop yields in the Minneapolis District improved with the rainfall,    though Chicago reported that yield prospects were mixed. In the Kansas City    District, cooler weather and scattered rainfall restored soil moisture and pastures    conditions, though cattle producers continued to draw down herds. Dallas, however,    said that while September rains assisted wheat producers and eased pressure    on livestock producers to liquidate herds, many parts of the District still    needed rain. San Francisco reported strong sales for livestock and most crops    but indicated that spinach producers put planting on hold.  Activity in the energy industry remained strong according to reports from the    Minneapolis, Kansas City and San Francisco Districts. Minneapolis indicated    that alternative energy industries continued to expand at a rapid pace and that    mining production was at near-capacity across the District. Kansas City noted    that oil and gas drilling rig counts remained above year-ago levels, while San    Francisco said that oil and natural gas extraction continued at a rapid pace.    In contrast, Dallas reported that activity in the oil and energy producing sector    was virtually unchanged although demand for oil-field equipment and energy services    remained strong.  Employment, Wages, Prices   Labor market conditions remained taut since our last report. The Boston, Philadelphia,    Richmond, Minneapolis and Dallas reports characterized labor markets as generally    tight, particularly for skilled workers, while the remaining Districts noted    that job growth was steady to stronger. Six Districts mentioned labor shortages,    particularly for professional, scientific, and other technical workers. In addition,    Kansas City said retailers faced shortages of experienced sales workers and    Atlanta indicated that residential construction firms were having difficulty    obtaining qualified construction workers, despite the slowdown in building activity.    In contrast, Cleveland reported that roughly half of the homebuilders they contacted    had reduced their labor force.  Wage growth around the nation was generally modest, although faster wage growth    for skilled services workers was cited by a number of Districts. The San Francisco    District noted that a short supply of healthcare, finance and construction workers    pushed wages higher. In addition, Richmond noted a sharp uptick in retail wages    and Atlanta reported that some manufacturers had raised entry-level wages in    an effort to attract workers.  Most Districts reported few signs of increased price pressures in recent weeks.    A number of Districts said that energy prices moderated, but increases in raw    materials prices were noted by Philadelphia, Richmond and Atlanta, and a rise    in building materials prices was reported by Minneapolis. Instances of businesses    passing on higher costs were scattered across Districts; Cleveland and Atlanta    said some manufacturers attempted to raise output prices while Boston reported    increases in retail prices. Boston also reported that costs for some businesses    had increased--especially for airfare and hotel accommodations. Likewise, the    New York District noted that accommodation and theatre ticket prices had risen    sharply compared to a year ago.",2006-10-12
38,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and based on information collected before November 20, 2006. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.   Most Federal Reserve Districts reported continued moderate growth since the    last report. However, New York and Richmond observed that growth accelerated,    whereas Dallas said the pace of activity continued to decelerate from high levels,    and Atlanta described activity as mixed.  Despite continuing softness in automobile and housing-related sales, most    Districts reported that consumer spending increased during October and early    November, and the retail sales outlook for the holiday season was cautiously    optimistic. According to most reports, growth in other service-producing industries    remained generally solid. Manufacturing activity was positive overall, with    the weakest reports concentrated among auto and housing-related producers. Reports    on housing markets continued to indicate an overall decline in single-family    home sales, and there were some reports of lower home prices. Indicators of    single-family construction continued to weaken in most Districts. However, housing    demand continued to be strong in a few specific markets, and nonresidential    activity generally improved. Many Districts noted a continued slowing in mortgage    lending, while reports on other lending were mixed. Some Districts reported    a slight increase in delinquencies.   A number of Districts continued to report that labor markets were tight, especially    for high-skilled occupations. Wage growth remained generally moderate, although    some Districts gave accounts of stronger wage pressures for some specialized    professions. Most Districts reported that prices moderated for construction    materials and energy products.  Consumer Spending   Most Districts reported increased consumer spending overall. However, there    was some regional variation in the rate of increase. For instance, solid increases    were reported by Kansas City and Richmond, while modest improvements in retail    spending were noted in the Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, New York, and St.    Louis Districts. Meanwhile, sales softened in the Boston District and were below    expectations in the Dallas District. Strong selling products varied by region,    but most Districts reported that sales of home-related items remained weak.    Several Districts noted a cautiously optimistic outlook for the holiday season.    Atlanta reported that high-end and electronics merchants were upbeat, while    more modest gains were expected from other retailers. Kansas City and Minneapolis    District merchants were said to be positive headed into the holiday season,    and sales in the New York, San Francisco, and St. Louis Districts are expected    to exceed year-ago levels. However, retail contacts in Boston remained concerned    about the downturn in the housing market, and Dallas described retailers as    more guarded.  Most Districts reported continued softness in vehicle sales, led by weaker    sales for the Big Three U.S. auto makers. Slow or declining sales were noted    by Philadelphia, Cleveland, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco, and high    vehicle inventories were reported by several Districts. The only account of    improved vehicle sales came from St. Louis, while Chicago described auto sales    as steady.   Services and Tourism   The demand for services remained healthy according to most reports. Boston reported    that conditions were good for firms providing software and information technology    services, particularly for companies catering to the health care and energy    sectors. San Francisco noted that service providers experienced generally strong    demand, especially in the food and beverage, health care, and transportation    sectors. New York and Richmond noted solid business activity in the financial    services sector.  The Atlanta, Boston, Minneapolis, New York, and Richmond Districts indicated    that temporary staffing firms experienced solid demand for their services, although    Chicago and Dallas noted that the demand for temporary workers had softened.    The Atlanta and Cleveland Districts reported disappointing demand for freight    services. Atlanta noted that much of the weakness was concentrated in businesses    specialized in moving building materials, while Cleveland reported softness    for shipments of auto-related products. St. Louis noted that the local freight    transportation sector was expanding. Dallas observed that transportation demand    was good, although contacts are anticipating slower growth in coming months.  Reports from the tourism industry were generally positive. Atlanta said that    the Mississippi Gulf Coast gaming revenues returned to near pre-Katrina levels    in October on the strength of re-opened casinos. Kansas City noted continued    high hotel occupancy and solid airport traffic. Boston reported that tourism    was currently ""going gangbusters"" and that business travel was strong.    Richmond and New York also observed that tourism was stronger than in the last    report.   Manufacturing   Manufacturing activity was generally positive in most Districts. New York said    manufacturers noted brisk growth in activity. Boston, Dallas, Kansas City, and    San Francisco reported that production trends in high-tech industries were positive.    Cleveland reported that durable goods production was up slightly on a year-over-year    basis, although demand for steel products continued to soften. Manufacturing    in the Chicago District expanded at a modest pace, with manufacturers of machine    tools and equipment reporting strong demand outside of the motor vehicle industry.    Dallas noted that energy-related manufacturing activity remained strong. In    the Philadelphia region, manufacturers posted small increases in shipments,    but there were also marginal declines in new orders. Most Districts reported    that orders for homebuilding materials and related equipment have trailed off    substantially. In addition, some softness in auto and auto-related production    was noted by Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, and St. Louis.  Real Estate and Construction   Almost all Districts reported that overall housing market activity continued    to slow, especially in the single-family segment. Most Districts cited declining    sales and rising home inventories. There were also scattered reports of price    reductions, while the use of non-price sales incentives was reported in the    Cleveland, Dallas, New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco Districts. Most    Districts reported declines in residential construction. For instance, according    to Cleveland, contractor backlogs decreased about 30 percent and fewer spec    homes were being built. Several Districts indicated that weak conditions are    expected to persist over the next several months. New York and Dallas noted    improved demand for rental housing, while Dallas reported that condominium construction    remained robust. Atlanta observed rising condominium vacancy rates in some markets.  According to most reports, nonresidential markets improved since the last    report. Strengthening demand for office space was seen in the Boston, Dallas,    Kansas City, Minneapolis, New York, and Philadelphia regions. However, some    slowing was noted in the Chicago District. Atlanta noted that the overall level    of nonresidential construction remained modest. In the San Francisco District,    commercial and public project activity continued to expand, although the pace    of growth was slower than earlier in the year.  Banking and Finance   Lending activity was mixed since the last report. Most Districts noted fewer    mortgage originations, although Chicago reported that mortgage refinancing activity    firmed. The demand for commercial and industrial loans was stable or slightly    higher in some Districts. Overall credit quality was described as good, although    Chicago, Cleveland, and San Francisco reported small increases in delinquencies.    Tighter credit standards were noted in the St. Louis and Richmond Districts.  Labor Markets and Prices   Reports suggest that labor markets remained tight since the last report, especially    for high-skilled occupations. Richmond reported strong demand for workers with    sales, life sciences, engineering, and financial skills. Boston said that there    was strong demand in industries such as health care, biotechnology, and engineering.    Kansas City noted shortages of engineers, oil field workers, accountants, welders,    sales people, and truck drivers. New York said that labor markets have strengthened    in a number of industries, including manufacturing, legal services, and banking.    Atlanta and Philadelphia reported that retailers were finding it difficult to    fill holiday-related positions. Dallas noted that labor shortages were acting    as a capacity constraint for some firms. Overall labor market conditions were    little changed according to Chicago, with small gains in employment on net.    Wage growth remained generally moderate, but Boston, New York, and San Francisco    reported faster wage growth for some specialized professions. San Francisco    noted continued rapid wage growth for health care, finance, and construction    workers. According to Boston, pay levels for professional and technical jobs    were being boosted in order to recruit new workers and reduce staff turnover.    Employers in the Philadelphia District indicated that wages have been rising    more rapidly in the past few months than earlier in the year, whereas the pace    of wage increases was steady according to Chicago.   Most Districts reported that prices moderated for construction materials and    energy products. Kansas City noted that prices for some building products have    moderated because of the combination of lower demand and reduced transportation    costs. However, Minneapolis reported further price increases for roofing shingles    and foam rubber, and Cleveland noted that prices for petroleum-related products    remained high. Atlanta and Chicago observed that lower energy prices had led    to a decline in some fuel surcharges. According to Philadelphia, price increases    were not as widespread as they were earlier in the fall. Richmond said that    prices for manufacturing inputs and finished goods rose since the last report,    and Chicago noted that toolmakers and food processors reported raising prices.    Agriculture and Natural Resources   Farm conditions were generally good, although there were reports that excessive    rains delayed harvest and field work in the St. Louis and Richmond Districts.    Higher prices for corn and soybeans benefited farmers in the Minneapolis and    Kansas City Districts. However, the higher feed costs hurt poultry and livestock    producers in the Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts.  Activity in the energy and mining sectors was generally robust in late October    through mid-November. Dallas, San Francisco, and Minneapolis reported that energy    extraction activity was strong, while Kansas City noted that activity declined    moderately but remained high by historical standards. Atlanta said that much    of the post-hurricane infrastructure repair work had been completed in the Gulf    of Mexico, and Dallas noted that the Gulf Coast refineries are now operating    at high levels.",2006-11-29
39,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and based on information collected before January 8, 2007. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.    Most reports from the Federal Reserve District Banks indicated that economic activity expanded at a modest pace since the last report. The New York and San Francisco Districts reported moderate growth, while the Dallas District reported further deceleration from a high level of activity.  The Minneapolis District reported slight growth. The Boston District characterized activity as mixed, and the Cleveland District saw softening activity.   Districts generally reported modest increases in retail sales, and vehicle sales were sluggish in several Districts. Tourism spending was up in a number of Districts. Reports on the service sector were generally positive; many Districts reported growth in technical, legal and information services. Manufacturing activity continued to expand in most Districts, with weakness reported mainly for products supporting the residential construction industry. Nearly all Districts reported a continued softening in housing markets, and high inventories of new homes have generally led to a slowing in residential building. In contrast to the housing sector, commercial real estate markets continued to see strong activity in most Districts. Lending activity was mixed, with commercial and industrial lending generally up while residential mortgage origination and refinancing continued to weaken. Overall weather conditions and high prices aided the agriculture sector. Energy production and exploration remained at high levels, and the alternative energy sector increased. Mining output grew.  District reports generally described labor market conditions as tightening and cited examples of some businesses having difficulty finding qualified workers. Despite expanded hiring, Districts reported relatively moderate gains in wages; however, some Districts noted certain business lines that experienced wage increases and have concerns about increases in the benefit portion of compensation. District reports indicated moderate price increases overall as prices for energy and a number of materials eased and competition kept prices for final goods in check.  Consumer Spending and Tourism Districts generally reported modest increases in retail sales. Several Districts described retail sales increases as slight or moderate. New York reported that sales were on or slightly above plan in December. Dallas characterized retail sales growth as good, but not great. Retailers in the San Francisco District reported a generally solid performance for the holiday season. However, Boston, Cleveland and Kansas City described retail sales as mixed. New York, Philadelphia, Richmond and Chicago noted strong sales in electronics. New York, Philadelphia and Richmond reported soft apparel sales, particularly in outerwear due to warm weather. In contrast, retailers in the Chicago and St. Louis Districts reported strength in apparel sales. Districts that commented on inventory levels described them as generally favorable or balanced, except for Boston, where several contacts reported higher-than-expected levels.    Vehicle sales were sluggish in several Districts. Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis and Kansas City reported slow vehicle sales. Auto sales were mixed in the Cleveland District, while Dallas reported a pickup in sales and San Francisco described sales as moderate on net. Several reports noted that foreign car sales were stronger than domestic truck sales; however, a few reports indicated strength in SUV demand due to lower gas prices.   Tourism spending was up in a number of Districts. Boston, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City and San Francisco provided positive assessments of tourism activity, while Richmond described activity as mixed and Minneapolis noted that tourism was in the doldrums in several areas due to a lack of snow. Tourism activity remained at high levels in most major markets in the San Francisco District, while tourism and travel exceeded expectations in the Boston metropolitan area.

While single-family construction weakened, New York saw multifamily permits on pace with a year earlier. In Cleveland, some builders reported a stabilizing market. Although Atlanta reported steep declines in Florida home building, activity was mixed in the rest of the District.

Dallas noted that the low-priced home market was slower than higher-priced segments. Realtors in San Francisco were offering significant incentives to sell properties. New York reported rent increases, while Dallas noted that apartment vacancies edged up in the cities of Dallas and Houston, largely due to an exodus of Hurricane Katrina evacuees.  In contrast to the housing sector, commercial real estate markets continued to see strong activity in most Districts. Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis and San Francisco saw increases in commercial building. New York reported that relatively little new office space was under construction in New York City, even though rents have increased and vacancy rates have fallen.

Demand for commercial and industrial loans rose in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, Kansas City and San Francisco Districts, was mixed in the Atlanta District and steady in the Chicago and Dallas Districts. Philadelphia saw an increase in credit card usage with a decline in other consumer loans, while Cleveland and Dallas saw consumer lending decrease. Overall credit quality remained good, but New York and Atlanta reported increases in consumer delinquencies and Chicago noted a small increase in mortgage delinquency. New York reported tightening standards for commercial and consumer loans.   Agriculture and Natural Resources Most Districts reported upbeat agricultural conditions because of weather and high prices. Good weather conditions, which aided the sector, were reported by Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City and Dallas. However, Minneapolis reported dry conditions, and Kansas City reported storms that adversely affected parts of the industry. High prices for many agricultural commodities were reported by Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco.   Activity in the energy and mining sectors remained at strong levels. Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco reported robust oil and gas activity. Cleveland and Kansas City noted some capacity constraints.

Atlanta, Minneapolis and Kansas City noted expanded hiring or signs of tightening. Boston reported that engineering and machinist positions were especially hard to fill and that finance and accounting workers were in great demand. In the New York District, hiring of office workers was strong, led by financial and legal services, but slower hiring was noted in manufacturing and distribution. Temporary employment agencies reported generally stronger demand for workers in the Philadelphia and Richmond Districts. In the Dallas District, labor markets remained very tight, with numerous firms continuing to report difficulty finding skilled and unskilled workers. Meanwhile, Cleveland noted that retail hiring was about the same as a year ago.  Despite expanded hiring, Districts reported relatively moderate gains in wages; however, some Districts noted certain business lines that experienced wage increases and had concerns about increases in the benefit portion of compensation. Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City and San Francisco described wage increases as moderate or continuing at rates similar to those in the preceding reporting period. However, Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Dallas and San Francisco mentioned higher increases for benefit costs, particularly health care.

40,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and based on information collected on or before February 26, 2007.  This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.   Most Federal Reserve Districts reported modest expansion in economic activity since the last report, but several Districts noted some slowing.  For example, New York characterized growth as well-maintained but with a few signs of deceleration.  In addition, St. Louis said that activity increased more slowly than in the previous period, Boston reported some softening, and Dallas said economic activity continued to decelerate.  On the other hand, Philadelphia reported economic conditions improved slightly.  The majority of Districts reported steady growth in retail sales, while vehicle sales remained sluggish.  Tourism activity was generally positive, and the demand for services continued to expand in most Districts, with strong increases in health care, accounting, legal, and technology services.  Manufacturing activity was steady or expanding, despite continued weakness in production related to the construction and auto industries.  Almost all Districts reported that housing markets remained weak, but signs of stabilization were noted in several Districts.  In contrast to the housing sector, commercial real estate markets continued to firm or remained solid.  Lending activity remained mostly unchanged from recent periods, as increasing demand for commercial and industrial loans continued to offset declines in residential mortgage lending.  Agricultural conditions generally improved across the country.  Energy production and exploration remained at high levels, but some Districts reported a slowdown from the previous survey. Most Districts noted further expansion in labor markets and continued tight supply of skilled and professional workers.  With rising demand for many types of workers, wage pressures increased slightly in several Districts, although pay increases generally remained moderate overall.  Most Districts characterized price pressures as little changed.  Energy and construction-related materials prices fell, but food input costs increased in several Districts.  Consumer Spending The majority of Districts reported steady growth in retail sales, but sales in some Districts were held back by bad weather.  Dallas noted a pick-up in sales, and Chicago said January sales were boosted by the increased popularity of gift cards this past holiday season.  Several Districts reported strong sales of consumer electronics, and New York, Philadelphia, and Atlanta said cold weather helped boost sales of winter and other apparel.  Unfavorable weather conditions in the Boston, Cleveland, and Kansas City Districts, on the other hand, were blamed for overall disappointing retail sales.  Richmond also reported weak sales, especially for big-ticket items.  Several other Districts reported poor sales of home-related items, such as furniture and appliances, due to weak residential real estate markets.  Most Districts reporting on inventories said contacts were pleased with current levels. Vehicle sales remained sluggish in most Districts, especially for domestic models.  St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco characterized sales as flat, and Philadelphia said sales were below year-ago levels.  Sales in the Atlanta District were generally poor, although contacts in South Florida noted stronger activity.  San Francisco noted that inventories of domestic trucks and SUVs remained high.  Minneapolis reported that some dealerships selling domestic vehicles have closed or plan to close; contacts in the Philadelphia District also anticipated some closings.  On the other hand, Chicago reported steady vehicle sales, with light trucks beginning to regain market share from more fuel-efficient cars.  Kansas City also noted an uptick in sales of trucks and SUVs. Services and Tourism The demand for services continued to expand in most Districts, especially for health care, accounting, legal, and technology services.  Boston, Richmond, and San Francisco reported robust services growth, and St. Louis also noted expansion in most services sectors.  Dallas said the rate of increase in demand for services decelerated further, though demand for legal services in the District was higher than a year ago.  Boston reported that software and information technology firms generally had positive outlooks; San Francisco also characterized conditions in the high-tech industry as strong.  Richmond reported increased demand for hospital services, and Boston noted strong growth in health care-related technology.  On the negative side, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Dallas reported lower activity in transportation services.  Atlanta attributed the weakness to lower demand from homebuilders, with rail contacts noting fewer freight shipments of lumber and other construction-related cargo.  Cleveland noted a decline in shipments of auto-related products. The majority of Districts characterized tourism activity as positive overall.  San Francisco reported strong activity in the Bay Area, and Dallas noted increased demand in air travel over the past six weeks.  Atlanta contacts reported that Mississippi Gulf Coast casinos were doing more business than before Hurricane Katrina, and Florida business travel is expected to increase moderately this year.  New York said tourism remained brisk, but noted some modest pullback recently from an exceptionally high level of activity in New York City.  Minneapolis, Boston, and Richmond said ski areas suffered from lack of snow, but heavy snowfalls benefited the Rocky Mountain ski resorts in the Kansas City District. Manufacturing Manufacturing activity was steady or expanding in most Districts.  New York and Kansas City noted a recent rebound in activity; Cleveland, Minneapolis, and San Francisco also reported increases.  On the other hand, Dallas, Richmond, and St. Louis reported slower growth or a decline in factory activity.  Chicago described manufacturing as sluggish, though with some recent signs of firming.  Producers of steel and machinery saw increased demand in many Districts, and San Francisco and Boston noted a rise in orders for commercial aircraft and aviation products.  Food manufacturing also experienced strong growth in the San Francisco and Dallas Districts.  Manufacturers in the New York District continued to express widespread optimism about the near-term outlook, and Kansas City, Philadelphia, and Cleveland reported increases in manufacturers capital spending plans.  Most Districts reported that manufacturing activity related to residential real estate remained sluggish, especially for production of household appliances, furniture, and building materials.  Atlanta, St. Louis, and Dallas reported a slowdown in manufacturing of auto-related products, while Cleveland said that although some auto-parts suppliers have seen a decrease in activity, auto production has increased.  Chicago said that light vehicle sales were running below plan, but producers had not yet adjusted their assembly schedules.    Real Estate and Construction Almost all Districts reported that housing markets remained weak, but signs of stabilization in the sector were noted in several Districts.  Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco reported that new residential construction continued to fall, and New York and Philadelphia noted that homebuilders had scaled back their plans.  But Cleveland and Atlanta noted that construction had flattened out.  Housing contacts in the Atlanta District reported that declines in sales were moderating, except in Florida.  San Francisco also noted a slowdown in the deterioration of conditions in California, though activity in hard-hit areas such as Arizona continued to contract.  In the New York District, builders in New Jersey reported some stabilization in the market for new homes, and demand for multi-family units in New York City remained strong.  Richmond said housing markets in general showed additional signs of firming, while contacts in the Kansas City and Cleveland Districts, where activity was still at low levels, were encouraged by recent increases in buyer inquiries.  Still, further contraction in housing markets was noted in several Districts, and home prices were generally flat or declining.  According to the Dallas District, inventories of unsold homes in the Dallas-Fort Worth area rose to new highs due to slowing sales and rising cancellations.  Contacts in the Boston District saw no signs that the weakness in housing was nearing an end.  Homebuilders in the Philadelphia District were making significant price reductions to move new homes, and real estate agents in that District reported that prices for existing homes had come to a standstill.  San Francisco also reported noticeable recent price declines in some areas, while Chicago reported that more than three-fourths of builders in the Chicago area were adding non-price incentives to sell homes.   Commercial real estate markets continued to firm in many Districts and remained generally solid or strong elsewhere.  New York did report a slight overall easing in the New York City office market, as vacancy rates edged higher in midtown Manhattan.  However, asking rents throughout the city were up 25 percent from a year ago.  Chicago also reported slightly slower expansion of nonresidential construction in the District as a whole but said office construction in downtown Chicago was quite strong and that office rents were increasing in the city.  Boston reported considerable increases in commercial investment throughout New England over the past year; Atlanta also said demand for commercial development remained strong.  According to the Richmond District, one area experiencing some difficulties in its office market was greater Washington, D.C., including northern Virginia, where high rents and lower optimism had reduced leasing activity.  Banking and Finance Lending activity remained mostly unchanged from recent periods, as increasing demand for commercial and industrial loans continued to be offset in most Districts by declines in residential mortgage lending.  Overall loan demand increased in the Philadelphia, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, while New York reported a decrease.  Demand for commercial and industrial loans increased or remained solid in most Districts.  New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported demand for residential mortgage loans had declined. Cleveland and Dallas reported some weakness in consumer lending, while Philadelphia noted an increase in such lending.  Credit quality was said to be generally unchanged.  However, New York, Richmond, and Atlanta reported some increase in residential mortgage delinquencies, and Atlanta and Chicago noted deterioration in credit quality in the sub-prime segment.  Tighter credit standards in commercial real estate were noted in the St. Louis District and on all types of loans in the New York District.   Agriculture and Natural Agricultural conditions generally improved across the country.  Winter snow and rain storms brought much needed moisture to many drought-stricken Districts.  St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas said the winter wheat crop was in good condition.  Richmond reported that a mild winter had improved livestock conditions.  San Francisco, however, reported that a harsh cold snap severely damaged citrus, avocado, and some vegetable crops.  Higher crop prices, especially for corn, generally increased farm income expectations and land values, and farmers in the Chicago, Kansas City, and Atlanta Districts intend to plant more corn in 2007.  However, livestock operators noted a decrease in profits due to higher feed costs.  Kansas City reported reductions in cattle herds in response to rising costs while Chicago noted that some livestock and dairy operators were exiting the industry.    Activity in the energy and mining industries continued at high levels in most Districts, but some Districts reported a slowdown from the previous survey.  Atlanta and Dallas reported strong interest in offshore oil exploration, and oil and gas production in the San Francisco District remained strong.  However, drilling activity slowed in the Kansas City District, and Dallas noted an overall easing in growth.  Contacts in both of these Districts commented that high drilling costs were the main cause of the pullback in activity.  High corn prices slowed the rapid expansion of ethanol production in the Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts.  Minneapolis said that mining activity remained near capacity and that iron ore shipments were expected to rise.  Coal production in the Cleveland District was flat, following recent reductions in coal prices.  Labor Markets and Wages, and Prices Most Districts reported further expansion in labor markets and continued tight supply of skilled and professional workers.  Boston noted aggressive hiring of health care workers and solid increases in technology employment.  Services firms in the New York District also reported strong levels of hiring.  Temporary help agencies in the Richmond District said demand for workers was robust, and staffing firms in the Cleveland District were upbeat about the current number of job openings.  Reports on staffing services were more mixed in the Boston District, although demand for professional workers remained strong.  Still, some sectors were reducing employment in a few parts of the country, including auto manufacturing in the St. Louis and Chicago Districts and construction in the Dallas District.  Difficulties in finding workers persisted in many Districts, including Atlanta, where health care and low-skilled tourism workers remained in especially short supply.  Kansas City and Dallas noted continued shortages of engineers, oil field workers, and accountants.  With rising demand for many types of workers, wage pressures increased slightly in several Districts, although pay increases generally remained moderate across the country.  New York reported widespread wage increases among non-manufacturing firms.  Above-average wage increases were also reported for occupations in short supply in the Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and Dallas Districts.  San Francisco and Kansas City reported slightly faster recent growth in non-wage compensation of workers, including bonuses and health-care benefits.  Minneapolis said wage pressures were moderate outside of the energy sector, which has experienced double-digit wage increases.  Price pressures were little changed overall.  Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and Kansas City reported increases in input costs, though Philadelphia said the rate of increase was lower than in the fall.  And, Philadelphia and Cleveland reported steady retail prices.  Chicago said raw materials prices were little changed at high levels.  Boston reported an overall lessening in input costs, and most respondents expected their selling prices to remain stable or rise modestly this year.  Similarly, New York noted stable input price pressures and steady consumer prices.  In contrast, Richmond reporting an edging up of retail price inflation, and Atlanta noted that service firms have been more successful than others in passing costs on to consumers.  Dallas said that prices fell for a number of products, including lumber, petrochemicals, and plastics.  A number of other Districts also reported a continued moderation in energy prices and construction materials, most notably lumber and copper.  San Francisco reported a decline in several raw materials prices in the agriculture, transportation, and electronics industries but noted a significant increase in food processing input costs, causing producers to raise prices in that industry.  Food producers in the Kansas City District also noted rising input costs due to higher farm commodity prices.  Cleveland and Dallas reported an increase in steel prices due to strong global demand and reduced import competition.",2007-03-07

Additionally, the Dallas District reported that builders are significantly curbing home starts.  Commercial real estate markets continued to be active across most Districts.  Commercial real estate markets remained robust in the St. Louis and New York Districts, and the Kansas City District reported solid gains.

Kansas City reported unchanged credit standards, while New York reported steady to slightly tighter credit standards for all loans.  Both the Dallas and Cleveland Districts reported slightly tighter mortgage credit standards. Agriculture Weather since the previous report has had mixed effects on agricultural conditions.  Recent rains improved soil moisture in the Minneapolis and Dallas Districts and eased drought conditions in the Kansas City District.  Atlanta reported that drought-like conditions lowered the outlook for some crops.  Severe cold weather and frost in early April were reported by Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Chicago.  Of these, all but Chicago reported crop damage caused by the cold snap.

Retail hiring was reported to be steady in the Boston and Cleveland Districts, but new hiring was limited to new store openings and replacement.   Wages Wage increases were reported in some industries of the New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts.  These were generally modest.  Specifically, the New York, Richmond, Atlanta, and Dallas Districts noted wage increases in some services sectors, and the Richmond District also noted faster wage growth in the retail sector.  The Dallas District noted that continued layoffs reported by homebuilders and some manufacturers resulted in downward wage pressures.  The San Francisco District indicated that wage pressures eased in the construction and agriculture sectors.

In response to higher input prices, some manufacturing businesses in the Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas Districts were able to raise output prices.  In contrast, some manufacturers in the Kansas City and San Francisco District were unable to raise output prices.  Retailers and service firms in the New York, Philadelphia, Kansas City, Richmond, and Dallas Districts indicated that prices remained stable or increased modestly.",2007-04-25
42,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia based on information collected before June 4, 2007.  This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a representation of the views of Federal Reserve officials.    Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Banks indicated that economic activity continued to expand from mid-April through May.

Consumer spending and retail sales were generally up in late April and May, with a number of Districts reporting that luxury items were selling better than lower-end merchandise. On net, there was little change in auto sales across the Districts, and dealers are about evenly split on whether there will be any pickup in sales over the summer. Travel and tourism remained healthy despite the recent rise in gas prices, although the rise in prices remains a concern for the summer. Except for trucking, reports from the service industries were generally positive. Declines were widely reported in the trucking industry, however. Manufacturing activity was up in a majority of Districts.  There was weakness among manufacturers producing for the residential construction industry but strength among machinery and equipment manufacturers in several Districts. There was continuing weakness in residential real estate and construction but increasing strength in the commercial real estate sector, including both office and industrial space. Half the District banks reported little or no change in overall loan demand, with strength in commercial lending and weakness in residential mortgages and consumer lending. In the agricultural sector, crop conditions improved and were generally described as good. An early spring frost harmed some winter wheat, and drought conditions caused problems in the Southeast and the far West. Oil and gas exploration increased in recent months, but coal production was down. Hiring activity picked up in late April through May, especially for workers with specialized skills. But most Districts reported that overall wage pressures do not seem to have increased. There have been significant price increases for energy-related products and selected raw materials, but the prices of some raw materials have remained stable. Consumer Spending and Tourism Consumer spending and retail sales were up in late April and May, but changes in consumer spending varied by category and by District. San Francisco reported moderate growth in sales, and Chicago reported a gradual increase in consumer spending. The majority of retail contacts in St. Louis said sales met or exceeded expectations. New York noted that retail sales were close to plan, with business particularly brisk in New York City. However, contacts in four Districts--Cleveland, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas--noted that sales were disappointing or below expectations. Atlanta and Minneapolis described sales growth as marginal or modest. According to contacts in Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco, luxury items were selling better than low-priced items. Several District banks reported weakness in sales of big ticket items such as furniture and household durables. Mall traffic was down in Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis, and Kansas City. Reports from Cleveland, Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco suggest that higher gasoline prices may have restrained consumer spending on other items. Retailers in Boston, New York, Chicago, and St. Louis generally reported inventories at expected or desired levels. Philadelphia reported no major change in inventories, while Atlanta and Kansas City reported that inventories had risen. Looking forward, a majority of retailers in St. Louis see year-over-year sales increases this summer, and Philadelphia retailers see sales growth continuing at the current rate. But in Cleveland and Kansas City retailers anticipate slower or modest sales growth in the immediate future. Auto sales were steady or little changed in five Districts: Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco. They picked up in the last few months in Philadelphia from low levels earlier in the year, and they were above last year's level in St. Louis. Auto sales were down, however, in Atlanta and Kansas City. Dealers in St. Louis and Kansas City remain optimistic about a pickup in sales, but dealers in Philadelphia and Cleveland do not expect much change. Spending on travel and tourism remained healthy despite the recent rise in gas prices. Spending by tourists was strong in Boston, New York, Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and much of the San Francisco District. Reports from Boston, New York, and Kansas City mentioned higher rental rates for hotel rooms. Tourism was down, however, in Hawaii and in Michigan. Contacts in several Districts expressed concern that higher gas prices may negatively affect travel and tourism this summer. Services With the exception of trucking, growth in the service industries generally has been positive. Information technology services experienced double-digit growth year over year in the Boston area. Both Dallas and San Francisco reported solid demand for IT services. Minneapolis mentioned growth in professional services generally, and Dallas reported strong demand for corporate legal services and accounting. In the trucking and shipping industry, sluggish demand or declines were noted in half the Districts: Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco. Dallas was the only District to mention a pickup in the trucking business. Manufacturing Most Districts reported that manufacturing activity was up in the most recent period. Growth rates varied by industry group, however, and some Districts experienced little or no overall growth. Cleveland and Chicago reported stable conditions or little change in the manufacturing sector. St. Louis said manufacturing activity was mixed. Richmond is the only District that reported a decline in manufacturing activity. Some Districts (Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco) mentioned that industries producing for the residential construction market were weak. On the other hand, four Districts--Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago--mentioned that there was strength among machinery and equipment manufacturers. While several Districts mentioned capital spending plans, reports on capital spending from Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Kansas City were particularly positive. Both New York and Philadelphia noted that manufacturers were optimistic about growth over the remainder of this year. Manufacturers in Boston and Cleveland expected little change in activity. Real Estate and Construction The real estate and construction industries were marked by continued weakness in the residential sector and increasing strength in the commercial sector.  Most Districts characterized their housing markets as soft or weak. San Francisco reported that sales volumes for both new and existing homes fell further in most areas, with modest price declines in some parts of the District. Minneapolis described the District's housing markets as mostly weak, and Dallas described the District's housing markets as soft, noting high cancellation rates for new home sales in Dallas and continued slowing in the Houston market. Philadelphia reported no improvement in the housing market, and Cleveland reported that new home sales were stable but prices were down. Atlanta reported that sales stabilized at low levels in parts of Florida but continued to decline in Georgia. Reports from Richmond and St. Louis were mixed, with sales stabilizing or improving in some areas but declining in others.  The most positive report on housing markets came from the New York District where there were signs of strengthening in New York City, parts of Long Island, and some close-in New Jersey suburbs. However, housing markets in the rest of the New York District remain sluggish. No District reported an increase in new home construction. Moreover, inventories and days on the market continue to rise in some Districts, although the Kansas City District has seen a reduction in inventories. Realtors in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Atlanta Districts anticipate that the weakness in the housing market will last several more months at least. There was widespread improvement in commercial real estate markets in recent months. More than half the Districts reported that leasing activity was picking up in most of their major markets and vacancy rates were falling. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco also mentioned increases in office rents. Four Districts (Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis, and Dallas) reported strong demand for industrial space, especially warehouse space. Chicago, on the other hand, reported that industrial development was sluggish. All the Districts that mentioned commercial construction activity gave positive reports. Banking and Finance Half the Districts reported little or no change in overall loan demand: New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Philadelphia noted that loans were increasing at a steady pace, and San Francisco reported further growth in loan demand. There was more strength in commercial lending than in consumer lending. About half the Districts noted increases in commercial lending, and growth in commercial lending was reported to be solid or strong in Philadelphia, Richmond, and Dallas. Kansas City, on the other hand, experienced an easing of C&I loans except for commercial real estate. Consumer lending increased at a steady pace in Philadelphia, and lending for autos and marine equipment was up in Cleveland. But Dallas saw a decline in lending for autos. Residential mortgage lending was either declining or flat in all the Districts reporting except New York, where there was a pickup in mortgage lending. New York, Atlanta, and Chicago mentioned higher mortgage delinquencies. In Philadelphia and Cleveland lenders have little or no expectation of a pickup in mortgage lending through the rest of this year. Credit standards are mostly unchanged, except for home mortgages in New York and commercial real estate in St. Louis. Agriculture and Natural Resources In most Districts crop conditions were described as good or improving. But Chicago reported that crop conditions were mixed, ranging from ""stunted"" to ""excellent."" A spring frost in parts of Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Kansas caused damage to the winter wheat crop. Drought conditions in the Southeast and in parts of the San Francisco District hindered crop development and harmed pasture land. In the San Francisco District some cattle were brought to market early because of the lack of adequate grazing land. A number of Districts noted higher prices for corn, soybeans, and wheat. The higher cost of feed grains has resulted in higher prices for cattle and hogs. Exploration and development of oil and gas increased in the Atlanta and Minneapolis Districts. The rig count was up modestly in the Kansas City District, and the number of rigs is expected to continue to increase. Rig counts have remained stable in Texas, but they are at relatively high levels. Older rigs, however, are being refurbished. Oil and gas development was described as high in Cleveland and production as flat to slightly up. But coal production is down in the Cleveland District. Minneapolis reported that mining production was flat but the industry was producing at near capacity. Labor Markets, Wages, and Prices Several District reports mentioned that hiring activity increased in the late April through May time period. Staffing agencies in Boston and New York noted that demand was high for workers in information technology, medical, and financial service industries. Several Districts mentioned that the market for workers with specialized skills was tight. On the other hand, layoffs continued among home builders and in the manufacturing and service industries associated with home building. Wage increases were variously described as modest (Atlanta), steady (Philadelphia), or moderate (Minneapolis and San Francisco). Kansas City reported that while wages were up, wage pressures had eased since the previous report. More than half the Districts mentioned higher energy prices for both producers and consumers. Several Districts (Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas) reported rising prices for selected raw materials, such as copper. Atlanta and Chicago noted, however, that prices for raw materials were steady or even down. There were differing reports on the costs of construction materials. Kansas City reported that construction costs were mixed. Atlanta said the cost of construction materials was lower, and Dallas said the cost of building materials was moving up. At the consumer level both Kansas City and Dallas mentioned the rising cost of food.  However, District reports generally did not indicate an increase in overall price pressures.  For example, Chicago noted that price pressures were similar to the last report, and San Francisco observed that overall price inflation seemed to be modest.",2007-06-13
43,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and based on information collected before July 16, 2007. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.     Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Banks indicated that economic activity continued to expand in June and early July. New York, Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco described the pace of growth as ""moderate"" while Cleveland and Chicago saw it as ""modest."" Philadelphia noted that economic conditions improved. Kansas City said the regional economy continued to grow but at a moderating pace, and Dallas characterized its economy as strong but said it decelerated. Boston and Atlanta described business contacts' reports as ""varied"" or ""mixed.""  On balance, consumer spending rose at a modest pace, although a number of Districts indicated that sales were mixed or below expectations. Several reports indicated that capital spending increased, and expenditures for most business services continued to rise. Employment increased further in most regions and in many sectors of the economy. Most Districts said that residential construction and real estate activity continued to decline. Commercial construction and real estate markets were generally more active than during the previous reporting period. District reports indicated that manufacturing activity continued to expand during June and early July. Household lending declined in most regions, while commercial and industrial lending expanded at a modest pace. Contacts generally reported ongoing input cost pressures, particularly for petroleum-related inputs, while prices at the retail level continued to increase at a moderate rate. Energy and natural resource activity remained at high levels, or in some instances, rose further. Many Districts described overall wage gains as moderate and/or similar to the previous reporting period. Agricultural conditions varied widely, as the impacts of drought were felt east of the Mississippi River and heavy rains affected the Dallas and Kansas City Districts.  Consumer Spending and Tourism  On balance, consumer spending rose at a modest pace, although a number of Districts indicated that sales were mixed or below expectations Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis all shared the general assessment that consumer spending rose modestly, while Philadelphia said retail sales growth was quite strong in May but ""closer to trend"" in June. New York, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas reported sales as flat and/or below expectations. The remaining regions described sales as mixed. A number of Districts noted that high gas prices restrained spending; Chicago also noted a negative impact from high food prices, and Dallas mentioned that wet weather depressed sales. Five regions indicated that retail sales of items related to housing--such as furniture and home repair materials--were weak or declining. Retail inventories were generally at desired levels across the country, while Atlanta and San Francisco observed some increases. New vehicle sales in many areas were described as ""flat"" or ""lackluster,"" although dealers in Philadelphia and Chicago noted some improvement between June and early July. Many Districts commented on the relative strength of demand for fuel-efficient vehicles compared with larger automobiles and of foreign brands compared to domestics.  The majority of reports on tourism were positive. Strong gains were noted in many sections of the New York, Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. Minneapolis noted an increase in the number of Canadians visiting and shopping in the region, but Boston and San Francisco said that international tourism was down. Business Spending and Hiring  Several reports indicated that capital spending increased. Firms in New York, Cleveland, and Chicago said capital outlays increased according to plans. Current investment was mixed in Boston; Kansas City said capital expenditures were trimmed slightly during the reporting period but were expected to rebound to prior levels in coming months. Philadelphia indicated that investment plans increased compared with two months earlier. Reports on expenditures for most business services were generally positive. Several Districts noted strong gains by consulting, advertising, health care, scientific and technical, and telecommunications firms; demand for legal services was reported as mixed or unchanged by the Reserve Banks that commented on it. Philadelphia noted a significant increase in demand for business services from start-up and early-stage firms, and some contacts in the region expected further growth in overall service demand in the coming months. Demand for trucking firmed during recent weeks in Richmond and Dallas; reports in Cleveland ranged from strong growth to softening, while Atlanta and Chicago pointed to declines. Small-parcel shipping volumes were good in the Dallas region, and contacts there also expected a pickup in the future. Rail freight volumes declined in Cleveland and Dallas. Air travel was strong in Chicago and Dallas. Employment continued to increase in most locations and in many sectors of the economy. Richmond said hiring ""intensified,"" Minneapolis indicated that labor markets tightened, and Atlanta and Dallas said labor markets remained tight. Kansas City said employment expanded at a slower pace than previously. Cleveland reported a slight increase in manufacturing employment over the past six weeks, and Richmond indicated that the weakness in factory payrolls in the region had moderated, while Boston said manufacturing employment was unchanged. Retail hiring was limited to store openings in the Cleveland District. Employment in several service-providing industries increased in five Districts. Demand for temporary workers was strong in Richmond and Minneapolis, while Chicago reported a decrease in billable hours. Seven Districts referred to shortages of skilled workers in several industries including retail, construction, manufacturing, accounting, and engineering. Looking ahead, contacts in the New York report anticipated a moderate increase in manufacturing payrolls and a faster rate of nonmanufacturing hiring in the second half; respondents in the Philadelphia report projected that the rate of hiring in the third quarter would match that of the second quarter; a temporary help agency in the Chicago region expected demand to firm in the second half; and in the Minneapolis District, more firms expected to increase payrolls than decrease. Construction and Real Estate  Most Districts said that residential construction and real estate activity continued to decline on balance. Many Districts, however, noted increased activity in some individual market locales or segments. Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis said construction decreased. Boston and Kansas City said housing markets remained ""soft"" and ""weak,"" respectively, while San Francisco indicated that residential markets were weak and had slowed further in some areas. New York said markets were mixed but stable. Two notable exceptions were the Cleveland and Richmond regions, which experienced slight increases in sales. Atlanta said home inventories remained high, as did Dallas (even after a slight decline in the recent period). Inventories increased in Kansas City, but they declined in New York, and contacts in Boston and Cleveland described the number of homes for sale as ""normal"" and ""acceptable,"" respectively. District reports on home price appreciation were mixed: Boston noted a return to price appreciation and Kansas City indicated slower rates of decline. But Richmond and Chicago reported slower rates of increase or the beginning of declines, and in the Dallas District, some contacts projected a correction in entry-level home prices. Looking ahead, contacts in the Cleveland District were uncertain about how long it would be until the market turned, and analysts in Dallas had revised their housing outlook down. Contacts in Atlanta expected further declines overall, though they anticipated the market in Florida would be flat. Commercial construction and real estate markets were generally more active than during the previous reporting period. New York said markets strengthened and San Francisco reported continued firming. Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City indicated small gains in development. Richmond and Dallas described local markets as still ""solid"" and ""robust,"" respectively. Chicago said the pace of development was steady, and St. Louis said markets were mixed. Richmond and Chicago observed that overall commercial vacancy rates were stable. Office vacancy rates fell in four regions. Demand for industrial space increased in four Districts, while net absorption in the Minneapolis District was negative. Richmond, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported increases in rental rates for commercial space, and New York said that the asking rents for space ""continued to soar."" Manufacturing  Most District reports indicated that manufacturing activity continued to expand during June and early July. Richmond said that activity rebounded, and manufacturing appeared to expand in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco regions. Atlanta and Chicago pointed to general stability in the sector, while Kansas City and Dallas said activity ""slowed"" and ""cooled,"" respectively. Boston said half of their manufacturing respondents pointed to year-over-year declines while the rest said activity was expanding at ""normal"" rates. In most Districts, the increases in demand for factory goods were spread across a number of industries. The sectors consistently mentioned as facing strong demand included fabricated metals, defense-related products, aerospace, rubber, and processed food. A number of Districts noted that strong export demand boosted activity. Cleveland reported auto production had increased and was expected to continue moving higher, and an auto parts maker in the St. Louis region planned to increase output. San Francisco reported generally steady demand for information technology products, but noted that semiconductor sales had increased. Chicago reported stronger-than-expected demand for agricultural machinery and projections of further gains in the second half of the year. In contrast, manufacturers of housing-related products (lumber, stone, glass, cement, appliances, and furniture) typically reported declines. Looking ahead, manufacturers in Boston, Philadelphia, and Cleveland expected activity to increase at a modest pace; the expectations of contacts in the Kansas City region improved; and manufacturers in the New York District expressed broad-based optimism. Cleveland noted that steel service centers expected to maintain or slow shipments in the third quarter, while a steel contact in the Chicago region thought that an inventory build would be needed by the end of the summer. Banking and Finance  Household lending declined in most regions, while commercial and industrial lending expanded at a modest pace. New York, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco noted decreasing demand for mortgages, which in many cases was coupled with tighter underwriting standards. Cleveland indicated that consumer lending was flat to declining. In contrast, Philadelphia and Dallas reported that consumer lending was flat, and St. Louis said loans to individuals rose. Lenders in Philadelphia said it was unlikely they would meet their targets for this year, and bankers in Cleveland noted that they expected mortgage demand to remain weak into 2008. Interest rates on household loans increased in many Districts. Business lending increased in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco regions, but lending appeared to be flat in Richmond and Kansas City. Three Districts said commercial real estate loans were a notable source of strength, though New York reported declines in these loans. Household credit quality deteriorated marginally, while business credit quality remained mostly favorable. New York, Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco observed higher delinquencies on mortgages and other consumer loans. Richmond reported an increase in commercial loan delinquencies, while Philadelphia said late payments on commercial real estate loans remained low, and Chicago indicated that business credit quality was unchanged. Cleveland and Dallas reported no change in overall credit quality. Deposits were up slightly in St. Louis, flat in Atlanta, flat to down in Cleveland, down in Kansas City, and ""difficult to obtain"" in Dallas.  Prices and Labor Costs  Contacts generally reported ongoing input cost pressures, particularly for petroleum-related inputs, while prices at the retail level continued to increase at a moderate rate. Notable exceptions were the Richmond District, which reported faster rates of price increases as local businesses passed along higher input costs, and the Kansas City region, which experienced an easing in overall price pressures. Almost every region said that oil and gasoline prices were either rising, high, or ""an issue."" But the cost of natural gas decreased in the Cleveland and Dallas Districts. Prices of some construction materials, such as lumber and cement, declined in parts of the country. A few Districts reported high prices for metals, notably copper. Trucking firms generally passed along higher fuel costs through surcharges, but shippers were unable to implement any other price increases. Prices of manufactured goods increased or were expected to increase further in the Boston region. But Minneapolis reported that fewer contacts than in the past expected to be able to increase the prices of their products, and Cleveland said wholesale prices were steady. New York indicated that retail prices were steady or increasing modestly, and Kansas City said they were flat or lower. Reports on vehicle incentives were mixed, with Chicago saying they were steady and Dallas pointing to new discounts. Restaurateurs in the Kansas City District expected to raise prices in the future due to the higher cost of fresh foods.  Many Districts described overall wage gains as moderate and/or similar to the previous reporting period. However, many also pointed to significant upward pressure on wages and salaries for in-demand, high-skilled workers. Energy and Natural Resources  Energy extraction and refining activity continued at high levels in June and early July, with growth reported in four Districts. Deep-water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and activity in the Kansas City District pushed up demand for drilling rigs, equipment, and personnel. Utilization rates for Louisiana Gulf Coast refineries remained high. The Cleveland and Minneapolis Districts cited the development of alternative energy projects. Mining activity was flat, though near capacity, in the Minneapolis District. Agriculture  Agricultural conditions varied widely across regions. Above-average heat and a lack of moisture affected the Atlanta, Chicago, Richmond, and St. Louis Districts, while excess moisture impeded wheat and hay harvests in the Dallas and Kansas City Districts. The Atlanta District bore the brunt of an expanding drought, which hurt crop development in the Chicago and Richmond Districts as well. Crop conditions were generally favorable in the Dallas, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and St. Louis Districts. Forage and pastures were bad enough in the Atlanta and Richmond Districts that livestock herds were reduced, whereas pastures and ranges improved in the Dallas and Kansas City Districts. Prices for many agricultural products increased during the reporting period, with corn, hogs, and cattle as notable exceptions. Due to price movements combined with higher feed costs, hog and cattle producers faced tightening margins. Increased exports supported agriculture, particularly in the San Francisco District.",2007-07-25
44,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and based on information collected before August 27, 2007. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.    Reports from the Federal Reserve    Districts indicate that economic activity has continued to expand.  St. Louis and Kansas City described the    pace of activity as moderate; Cleveland, Chicago and Minneapolis said their    economies were expanding at a modest rate; and Boston and Atlanta reported    that activity was mixed.  New York    cited continued expansion.  The    economies in Philadelphia, Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco continued to    grow; however, the pace of activity has slowed.  Most Banks reported that the recent    developments in financial markets had led to tighter lending standards for    residential mortgages, which was having a noticeable effect on housing    activity, and several noted that the reduction in credit availability added    to uncertainty about when the housing market might turn around. While several    Banks noted that commercial real estate markets had also experienced somewhat    tighter credit conditions, a number commented that credit availability and    credit quality remained good for most consumer and business borrowers.  Outside of real estate, reports that the    turmoil in financial markets had affected economic activity during the survey    period were limited.    Retail sales were generally positive,    with increases characterized as modest to moderate.  However, several Districts described motor    vehicle and furniture sales as slow.     Manufacturing activity expanded across most Districts, with reports of    softening demand for building materials and autos.  The weakness in the housing market deepened    across most Districts, with sales weak or declining and prices reported to be    falling or flat.  Most Districts    reported a continuing contraction in the residential mortgage market.    Commercial real estate activity was generally stable to expanding.  Demand for business loans held steady or    weakened, while consumer lending was mixed.     Agricultural conditions varied widely across Districts, with several    reporting damage to crops and pastures as a result of excessive heat and    drought conditions. Activity in the energy and mining sectors remained    positive in all of the Districts reporting on these sectors.  Nearly every District reported at least    modest increases in employment during the recent survey period.  Most Districts characterized their wage    increases as moderate or steady. Wage pressures were intense only in isolated    professions in short supply.  And most    Districts reported little change in overall price pressures.      Consumer Spending and Tourism Districts generally reported modest to    moderate increases in sales, although Boston, Cleveland, and San Francisco    described retail sales as mixed.     Dallas reported little change in consumer spending growth.  Richmond reported that retail sales posted    modest gains in July but pulled back sharply in    August.  New York, on the other hand,    described July sales as somewhat below plan, but August sales as ahead of    plan.    Furniture sales declined in    Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco while Boston experienced    stronger sales. Merchants in New York and Chicago reported a slight pickup in    sales of home furnishings.  Retailers    in Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and Kansas City noted solid-to-strong    back-to-school sales. However, Chicago and Dallas reported difficulty    comparing back-to-school shopping with last year because of school-year    timing.  Boston and Kansas City    reported strong sales of apparel items while New York and St. Louis    experienced mixed results.  Some    weakening in apparel sales was seen in Philadelphia, Cleveland, and    Chicago.    Vehicle sales were described as slow or subdued in    many Districts.  Cleveland, Richmond,    Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco, all reported sluggish    new vehicle sales.  In contrast, auto    dealers reported that sales increased modestly in Kansas City and picked up    slightly in Philadelphia.  Cleveland    and San Francisco noted strength in used vehicle sales.  Many auto dealers reported anxiety about    future sales due to tighter household credit conditions.   Districts that commented on retail inventory levels    generally described them as at or above desired levels. Several retailers    reported that they planned to or had already heavily discounted merchandise    to move inventory.   Most reports on tourism were positive,    with the New York, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts reporting    particularly solid growth in tourist spending.  Minneapolis cited dry, warm weather for    helping the tourism industry.  Two    Districts were less positive on tourism:     San Francisco experienced slowing tourist activity and Chicago    described a pessimistic outlook for the rest of the year despite a slight    pickup in some parts of the District in August.    Services Reports on the service industry were    generally neutral to positive.  Several    Districts posted strong gains in financial services, health care, information    technology, and technical and professional services. Demand for legal    services was stable or showed modest increases.  Demand for transportation services showed    signs of softening--Atlanta and Dallas reported decreased activity while    Cleveland and Chicago cited no change.     Reports from Boston, Richmond, Minneapolis, and Dallas indicated that    the recent volatility in financial markets may slow down the pace of business    activity.  Manufacturing Most Districts reported that    manufacturing activity expanded during late July and early August.  New York, Richmond, Minneapolis, and San    Francisco indicated solid growth.     Philadelphia, Chicago, and St. Louis stated that manufacturing    expanded but at a slower pace.     Manufacturing was stable to increasing slightly in Cleveland, Kansas    City, and Dallas, but was described as mixed in Boston and Atlanta.  The automobile and building materials    industries showed weakness across most reporting Districts. Cleveland,    Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas all indicated that the auto sector had softened,    though one report suggested that some of the reduction in production was    related to model changeovers.  Six    Districts said that industries related to housing experienced weakness,    including building materials and construction equipment.    Industries showing improved conditions    varied markedly across Districts.     High-technology manufacturing was strong in the Kansas City and San    Francisco regions and showed steady growth in the Dallas District.  A number of Districts reported steady to    solid growth in aircraft and electrical equipment production and strength in    exports.  Chicago noted that some steel    producers have started exporting steel regularly for the first time.  Most Districts indicated that input price    pressures held steady or rose modestly compared to the previous report.  Expenditures for plant and equipment    remained close to plan in Boston and Cleveland.  Contacts in San Francisco reported that    productivity improvements continued on trend in 2007.  Looking forward, contacts in New York,    Philadelphia, Richmond, and Kansas City expressed near-term optimism about    business conditions in their sectors; reports from Cleveland and Dallas were    somewhat more cautious.     Real Estate and Construction       Residential real estate and construction weakened further in most    Districts while the commercial market remained steady.  Most Districts reported weak or declining    residential sales and declining or stable prices.  Markets in a few Districts did show some    strength.  Both sales and prices have    been increasing in the Massachusetts housing market; the New York City    apartment market remains tight as rents rise; and home sales rose in    Louisville.  Inventories of unsold    homes are generally reported to be high.     Moreover, contacts in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta,    Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas believe softness in the market will continue    in the near future, with potential for further declines.    Commercial    real estate and construction markets were generally stable to expanding    across the Districts. Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and San Francisco indicated    continued expansion in nonresidential construction and commercial real    estate.  Dallas described the level of    nonresidential activity as high, and St. Louis said commercial construction    remained strong.  New York, Cleveland,    Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City indicated commercial construction    and real estate markets were steady or stable. Vacancy rates are reported to    be low or declining in most Districts, and rents are rising modestly in    many.  Boston, New York, Richmond,    Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas noted some tightening of credit in the    commercial real estate market.    Banking and Finance The demand for residential mortgages continued a    downward trend in most Districts. Consumer lending softened in New York,    Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas, while St. Louis reported stable    activity.  In Philadelphia, personal loans    increased on credit card lending. Looking forward,    lenders in Dallas do not expect any further deterioration in consumer lending    after the softening that was reported earlier in the year.  Bankers in Philadelphia continue to see    growth in personal lending over the next few quarters, albeit at a slower    rate than in the first half of the year.  More than half of the Districts reported    a tightening in credit standards.     Boston, New York, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City and Dallas mentioned    tightening for both residential mortgages and business loans, while financial    institutions in Atlanta and San Francisco said tighter standards were aimed    primarily at home mortgage products.     Delinquencies in consumer loans and mortgages rose slightly in    Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis, while New York reported no change    in delinquencies across all loan categories.  Demand for business loans was steady or    weakening in New York, Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis, while Philadelphia    reported an increase in demand.  Commercial real estate lending increased in    Kansas City and was quite strong in San Francisco, where ""some banks    reportedly are approaching regulatory limits on loan concentrations for this    segment.""  Agriculture Agricultural conditions varied across    Districts.  High temperatures and    drought conditions resulted in damage to crops and pastures in the Richmond,    Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts. According to some estimates, the    drought could cost Georgia and Florida farmers over $2 billion in lost production.  Nevertheless, a report from Chicago    indicated that even with unfavorable weather, the District was poised for a    record corn harvest because farmers had planted more corn at the expense of    soybeans. In the Dallas and San Francisco Districts, favorable summer rains    boosted pasture growth and livestock conditions.  Rains in the Kansas City District resulted    in above-average wheat yields and improved growing conditions for corn and    soybeans, which placed some downward pressure on crop prices. Further,    livestock prices remained solid, although rising production costs trimmed    margins for hog producers and cattle feedlot operators.  In the San Francisco District, demand for    agricultural products continued to grow, and supply conditions were largely    favorable.  Some agricultural contacts    reported that pressures on input costs eased overall, but others noted that    prices of feed grain increased further.  Natural Resources Activity in the energy and mining sectors remained    positive as increases were observed in all Districts reporting on these    developments.  In Dallas, energy    activity remained robust--domestic drilling has flattened out, while    international drilling is growing and remained the primary source of strength    for service companies.  Kansas City reported    stable drilling activity and expected increased activity heading    forward.  Cleveland's oil and gas    producers reported production levels were flat to increasing slightly since    mid-July.  Both Cleveland and Kansas    City cite the lack of qualified labor as a continuing strain on    expansion.  In the Minneapolis    District, activity increased since the previous    report, with mining production remaining at near capacity.  The Atlanta District reported that    Hurricane Dean did not have a significant impact on energy production along    the Louisiana coast.  Labor Markets, Wages, and Prices Nearly every District reported at least    modest increases in employment during the recent survey period.  The lone exception was Chicago, which,    instead, characterized employment conditions as mixed.  Philadelphia and San Francisco made no    statement characterizing overall changes in District employment.  New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis,    and Dallas described their labor markets as tight.  Nine of the twelve Districts reported that    there were shortages of some skilled workers, including those in the    information technology, accountancy, legal, and health care professions. In    addition, Kansas City noted shortages for workers with lower skills, such as    housekeepers and waiters, while San Francisco reported that agricultural    workers were in increasingly short supply.     Staffing services firms reported more demand for temporary workers in    several Districts (Boston, Richmond, and Dallas), but less demand in    Cleveland.  Several Districts reported    declines in construction employment, though the San Francisco District    reported that, in some areas, rising commercial construction has helped keep    overall construction employment stable.  Though some Districts described    employment condition as tight, most reported that wage increases were    moderate or steady.  Wage pressures    were intense only in isolated professions in short supply. Several Districts    also noted that costs of health care benefits continued to post large    increases, although they were not accelerating.   Most Districts reported little change in    overall price pressures.  There was    downward pressure on residential real estate prices across nearly all    Districts. Three Districts--Boston, Philadelphia, and Dallas--reported lower    lumber prices, while Atlanta reported that these prices stabilized.  Three Districts noted discounting among    retailers during the back-to-school selling season (New York, Philadelphia,    and Dallas), while two others reported overall declines in retailers' prices    (Richmond and Kansas City). However, higher food costs continued to be widely    reported and were said to be putting upward pressure on grocery and    restaurant prices.",2007-09-05
45,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and based on information collected on or before October 5, 2007. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.   Anecdotal reports from the Federal Reserve Banks suggest economic activity continued to expand in all Districts in September and early October but the pace of growth decelerated since August. Growth was similar to that observed in the last Beige Book in seven Districts--Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia and St. Louis. The economy grew at a slower rate in five Districts--Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City, Richmond and San Francisco. The expansion was variously characterized as ""moderate,"" ""modest"" and ""mixed."" Consumer spending expanded, but reports were uneven and suggest growth was slower in September and early October than in August. The manufacturing and service sectors continued to expand, but growth weakened--mostly for products and services related to home construction and real estate transactions. Several manufacturing and service firms reported that weaker domestic demand was offset by strong sales to global markets.  Residential real estate markets continued to weaken, and most Districts reported additional declines in home sales, prices and construction. Financial institutions reported an increase in delinquencies and slight deterioration in credit quality. Lenders in many Districts tightened credit standards, particularly for real estate. The majority of reports indicated an increase in business lending but a decline or slower growth in consumer lending.  Activity in the energy industry is still robust but growth has slowed. Favorable agricultural conditions are contributing to a bumper crop throughout much of the country, but drought continues to hamper production in the southeast. Contacts in a number of industries indicated a higher-than-usual degree of uncertainty about the outlook for economic activity. Many real estate contacts expect housing markets to remain subdued for several months. At firms without direct ties to real estate and construction, contacts are still wary that credit tightening and slowing construction might slow activity in their industry, but there is cautious optimism because few see much evidence of such spillovers at this time. Job growth eased in some regions, but labor shortages were reported for many occupations in most Districts and are said to be restraining economic activity in some instances. Wages rose moderately except for workers in short supply, where sharp increases were reported for some positions. Upward pressure on input costs are reported in most Districts, but competitive pressures are restraining the ability to pass higher input costs to selling prices in many instances. Consumer Spending and Tourism Retail sales increased, but reports were uneven and suggest growth has softened. Sales were weak at department and discount stores and for furniture and other home durables. Purchases of electronics and luxury items remained solid. Unseasonably mild weather dampened apparel sales in some regions. There appeared to be a high level of uncertainty about the outlook for retail sales, and a few Districts report that retailers have reduced inventories. Vehicle sales were weaker, but reports indicated that sales of fuel-efficient and used cars remained strong. Tourist activity was generally solid. Manufacturing Factory activity continued to expand, but reports suggested that growth has been dampened by declining output of products used in home construction. A few Districts noted that export demand for other products helped sustain growth. District reports indicated strong growth of sales for paper, steel, machine tools, agricultural machinery, energy equipment, electrical equipment, defense and aerospace, chemicals and health-related equipment. The outlook for factory activity is uneven. Boston District contacts noted continued weakness in housing and possible negative spillovers from tight credit but point to export growth and new product development as sources of strength. Manufacturers in the Cleveland District anticipate production remaining at current levels or decreasing slightly. Factories in the Kansas City District cut inventory levels and expect further reductions. Automakers in the Chicago District anticipate weakness in auto sales, but the St. Louis District reports major hiring to support the opening of new facilities for motor vehicle parts manufacturing. Services Districts reporting on business services indicated the sector is in expansion but the strength varied. Temporary staffing firms reported increased hiring, with the exception of activity to support financial services and real estate. Shipping activity was mixed and suggests some softening. Container shipments and regional freight activity were softer in the Atlanta and New York Districts, but freight hauling and shipping firms in the Dallas District reported increases in volume. Dallas District airlines say traffic is steady and bookings are solid. Construction and Real Estate Home sales continued to fall or increased more slowly in most Districts. In some instances, buyers could no longer secure financing or were unable to sell their current homes. New home inventories remained elevated, and builders continued to curb new home construction. Rising inventories of existing homes added to uncertainty about the overall health of the housing market. Commercial market fundamentals remained solid. Most Districts reported steady absorption of commercial space. Rental rates were firm to rising across Districts, with sizable increases for Manhattan office space. Construction activity continued at a steady pace overall. Some softness in commercial investment activity was noted, however, and several Districts reported a move to more conservative financing. Reports suggested developers are becoming more cautious--in some cases shelving or canceling projects. Banking and Finance District reports indicated increased delinquencies and a slight deterioration in credit quality. Lenders in many Districts tightened credit standards, including for consumers and all types of real estate. Consumer lending grew more slowly in most Districts. Lending for home mortgages, equity lines and refinancing continued to soften or decline in most Districts, which some reports attributed to tighter lending standards. Overall business lending was up, but tightening lending standards were applied, particularly for real estate. Agriculture and Natural Resources Favorable agricultural conditions in much of the country have allowed harvests to run ahead of normal schedules and contributed to above-average crop yields throughout much of the country. A near-record corn crop and above-average soybean yields are expected. Livestock producers reported strong demand and high prices. Bumper crops have strained storage capacity and caused transportation problems. The Chicago District notes that transportation and storage problems emerged because of the size and speed of the harvest and because cash prices are enough lower than futures prices that farmers have an incentive to store crops until 2008. Crop production has been hampered by dry or drought conditions in Alabama, the Carolinas, Georgia, Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia. Shortages of feed and low forage supplies have led some livestock producers in these areas to cull their herds. The Chicago District reports that crop yields in Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin were less affected by a summertime drought than had been anticipated by some observers. Energy activity held at robust levels, and oil production was up slightly. While natural gas drilling activity is still vigorous, there were reports that high costs have or will lead to reductions in production. The Kansas City and Minneapolis Districts reported that overall mining activity was strong and expanding, with mines in the Minneapolis District producing near capacity. Labor Markets Labor markets remain tight across much of the country, and there continues to be moderate upward pressure on wages and benefits. Job growth eased in some regions, however, and wage pressures softened. Most Districts report worker shortages in a variety of occupations, with sizable wage increases for workers in short supply. Positions mentioned as difficult to fill include scientific, technical, accounting, finance, engineering, marketing, health-care, truckers, welders, ironworkers, crane operators, office workers and energy-service workers. Low-skilled and entry-level workers are in short supply in some areas, including those in the retail and hospitality industries. Prices Upward pressure on input costs was reported by most Districts. Pushed up by strong domestic and international demand, energy and raw material costs are characterized as high by several Districts. Prices are up for a broad range of foods, including milk, corn, soybeans, wheat, beef, chicken and vegetables. Declines in the value of the dollar and high shipping costs have made imported goods more expensive. Insurance costs have increased in the Atlanta District. The ability to pass higher input costs to selling prices was mixed. Some manufacturers raised selling prices as a result of higher costs, such as for food products, chemicals, machinery and oil and gas equipment. But there were also reports of lower prices, particularly for construction-related materials, such as lumber, wood, wallboard and some metals, pushing down construction costs. Competitive pressures are restraining retail price increases in many instances. Prices are higher for food products and at restaurants. Vehicle prices are lower, with dealers using incentive and discount programs or manufacturers adding features to vehicles without raising prices. Reports from the service sector suggest there have been continued increases in fees and fuel surcharges, but the rate of increase has not changed.",2007-10-17
46,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco based on information collected on or before November 16, 2007.  This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.   Reports  from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that the national economy  continued to expand during the survey period of October through mid-November  but at a reduced pace compared with the previous survey period.  Among Districts, seven reported a slower pace  of economic activity while the remainder generally pointed to modest expansion  or mixed conditions.     District reports indicated  relatively soft retail spending; most retailers said that they were expecting a  slow holiday season, with only small gains in sales volumes compared with last  year. By contrast, tourist activity expanded further in most Districts.  Providers of nonfinancial services to  consumers and businesses generally saw continued solid growth in demand,  although a few Districts pointed to reduced demand for transportation services.  Reports from the manufacturing sector were  mixed across Districts and sectors, suggesting little change in activity on  net.  Producers in the agricultural and  natural-resources sectors saw robust demand, with sales of agricultural  products spurred in part by rapid growth in export demand.  The glut of available homes continued,  keeping downward pressure on prices and construction activity.  The demand for commercial real estate  remained strong in most areas but showed signs of leveling off in some.  Reports from banks and other financial  institutions suggested slower growth in overall loan demand, with some  Districts noting a reduction in the volume of commercial and industrial  lending.     Upward pressures on the prices of  final goods and services remained modest overall but were significant for  products and services that rely heavily on food and energy inputs.  Increases in the costs of energy and selected  raw materials pushed up production and transportation costs for firms in  various manufacturing and services sectors, although this was offset in part by  price declines for lumber and transportation equipment.  Food prices remained on an upward trajectory.  Outside of products and services that rely  heavily on energy and food inputs, final prices were reported to be largely  stable or down a bit.  Wage increases  were moderate in general; upward wage pressures eased in a few areas where  labor markets loosened slightly, although they remained strong for assorted  groups of skilled workers.  Consumer Spending and Tourism Reports on retail spending were  downbeat in general, with several significant exceptions. Most Districts  characterized sales as weak or indicated that they had softened, with a few  reporting that the volume of sales had fallen relative to the preceding survey  period or a year earlier.  However, the  Boston, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts highlighted a  pickup in retail sales relative to the preceding survey period.  Among product categories, several Districts  noted continued solid growth in sales of consumer electronics, while a few also  noted that demand for luxury goods continued to rise at a healthy pace.  By contrast, sales of automobiles and light  trucks were flat to down, with contacts from several Districts expecting  declines going forward.    Looking ahead, the reports were slightly  pessimistic about prospects for the holiday retail season.  Most Districts reported that retailers expect  growth in retail sales to be modest at best relative to last year, and  retailers generally were described as having a ""cautious"" attitude about the  upcoming holiday season.  Consistent with  this assessment, the Richmond, Dallas,  and San Francisco Districts reported early-season price discounting by  retailers.  In the Boston  and Minneapolis Districts, retailers expressed cautious optimism for holiday  sales, but they generally expect consumer spending to weaken in 2008.  Several reports indicated that retail inventories  have risen a bit of late and were higher than desired levels during the survey  period.    Activity in the travel and tourism  sector generally was at a high level and increased further in some cases.  The Richmond,  Minneapolis, and Kansas City  Districts reported that tourist bookings grew or were above normal seasonal  expectations during the survey period, and tourism activity in New    York City remained at a high level.  The Atlanta District reported that Florida's  tourist trade was up, spurred in large part by foreign visitors.  In contrast, visitor travel and business at  major tourist destinations in the San Francisco District, including Hawaii and  Southern California, have declined a bit from the high levels established in  2006. Nonfinancial Services Reports on nonfinancial services  generally were consistent with expanding economic activity, with the primary  exception of transportation services.  Several  Districts pointed to continued strong demand growth for health-care services,  while the Richmond, St.    Louis, and Minneapolis Districts noted an ongoing expansion  for providers of legal and other professional services.  The Dallas District reported steady demand  for legal services but noted a shift toward litigation related to bankruptcy  filings, which may signal a slowing economy.   In the San Francisco District, demand for advertising services was held  down by weak demand from sellers of automobiles and home furnishings.  Providers of temporary staffing services saw  strong demand in the Richmond District as well as a pickup from the legal and  financial industries in New York City,  but demand for temp workers was reported as ""sluggish"" overall by Dallas.     Available reports on the  transportation sector suggest that the level of activity declined somewhat  compared with the previous survey period.   The Cleveland District reported that trucking volumes were ""steady to  declining"" and that employment has fallen a bit; Dallas  noted that overall shipping activity has weakened; and Atlanta  reported lower shipping volumes for autos and materials for home construction. Manufacturing Manufacturing activity was mixed  across subsectors but appeared to be largely stable on balance.  Demand remained weak or fell further for  machinery and manufactured materials related to home construction, such as  lumber and concrete, and automakers have scaled back their production activities  this year.  By contrast, demand rose  solidly for various other types of capital goods, such as non-automotive  transportation equipment, information technology products, and machinery used  in the agriculture, energy extraction, and mining industries.  Chicago  reported that steel production increased, in part because of reduced import  competition of late, but Cleveland  characterized steel shipping volumes as ""flat"" in that District.  Among nondurable products, several Districts  noted continued robust demand for food and significant gains for paper and  plastics.  However, Dallas  reported ""stable"" demand for food and a drop in sales of corrugated boxes, and  St. Louis noted that food manufacturers plan to lay off workers in that  District.  The reports generally indicated  that increases in demand were especially strong for products and firms with  significant export markets, for which sales have been boosted in part by the  lower exchange value of the U.S. dollar.   Reports on capacity utilization suggested  that manufacturers on net were operating near long-term average levels, albeit  with substantial variation evident across sectors depending on the strength of  product demand.  The reports also  suggested little change in utilization rates during the survey period.  A few Districts reported on capital spending  by manufacturers and other businesses, noting tentative plans for continued  moderate capacity expansion, but with the proviso that actual spending will  reflect realized needs as they develop.  Real Estate and Construction   Demand for residential real estate  remained quite depressed, with only a few tentative and scattered signs of  stabilization amidst the ongoing slowdown.  Most Districts pointed to further increases in  the inventory of available homes, with the earlier tightening of credit  conditions for mortgage lending continuing to create barriers for some buyers.  Consequently, prices on new and existing  homes sold were reported to be down on a short-term or year-earlier basis in most  Districts.  The pace of homebuilding  remained very low in general, and builders continued to shelve projects and lay  off workers in many areas; contacts generally do not expect a significant  pickup in homebuilding until well into next year at the earliest.  Among scattered positive signs, however, co-op  and condo sales in New York City picked  up during the survey period, Richmond  reported favorable readings on home sales in a few areas, and Kansas    City reported that home inventories fell a bit in the Denver  metro area.  Weak home demand had mixed  effects on conditions in rental markets:   Chicago reported that  builders' conversions of new homes to rental property put downward pressure on  rents, while Dallas noted that  demand for apartments picked up, in part because some potential homebuyers are  unable to qualify for mortgages.   Demand for commercial, industrial,  and retail space generally remained at high levels and expanded further in some  areas, although signs of leveling off were evident in several Districts.  Vacancy rates on commercial and industrial  space remained relatively low in most Districts and declined in some, even  where substantial new space has been added of late.  Rents have risen accordingly in many areas.  In the extreme, New York  reported a 30 percent increase in asking rents on Manhattan  office space over the past 12 months; however, this represents a smaller  increase than in previous surveys, and a recent increase in vacancy rates there  is likely to further temper that trend going forward.  A few Districts reported emerging signs of  declining demand for commercial space:  this  included assorted indicators of weaker demand in the major metro areas in the  Boston District, reduced leasing activity in Philadelphia, commercial  construction activity that was described as ""flat to down slightly compared  with a year ago"" in Atlanta, and reduced transactions and rising vacancy rates  in some parts of the San Francisco District.   Construction of commercial and public buildings and infrastructure  projects remained high in most Districts, however, partly offsetting low  residential building activity and helping to limit losses in overall construction  employment.   Banking and Finance Lending to businesses generally was  at high levels, but the reports suggested a slower rate of growth than in  previous survey periods.  Commercial and  industrial lending activity changed little or declined in the Cleveland,  Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, although it  increased noticeably in the Philadelphia District and continued to show modest  growth according to Chicago.  Lending  standards for construction projects and commercial real estate transactions  tightened further in the New York  and St. Louis Districts, and they remained tight more generally and reportedly  held down the volume of lending for these categories in the Boston District.  The reports indicated slight increases in  delinquencies on commercial and industrial loans and slightly larger increases  for commercial mortgages in many areas.   Consumer lending was little changed  on net, while residential mortgage lending continued its downward slide.  More stringent credit conditions remained a constraint  for residential mortgage lending in general, with additional tightening during  the survey period reported by Chicago, Kansas  City, and Dallas; scattered reports  suggested slightly stricter standards on consumer loans as well.  Mortgage delinquencies increased  significantly in many areas, and some Districts pointed to slight deterioration  in credit quality for consumer loans. Agriculture and Natural Resources   Most Districts reported strong  demand for agricultural products and favorable production conditions, with the  primary exception of an ongoing drought in the Richmond  and Atlanta Districts.  Demand and sales  were reported to be quite strong for a wide variety of tree and row crops,  dairy products, and livestock.  Several  Districts noted that the rise in overall demand has been propelled in part by  the lower exchange value of the U.S. dollar, which has spurred strong increases  in export sales.  Harvest and growing  conditions were quite favorable in most areas.  High corn production and yields were reported by  Chicago, Kansas  City, and Dallas.  St. Louis  and Minneapolis described healthy  early-season conditions for winter wheat crops, while Kansas    City described that crop's progress as normal.  By contrast, dry weather undermined pasture  conditions and created a need for supplemental feedings to livestock herds in  the Kansas City and Dallas  Districts.  Moreover, drought conditions  continued in the Southeast, and this reduced or delayed crop plantings and held  down crop yields in the Richmond  and Atlanta Districts.   Reports on the natural-resources  sector indicated further growth from very high levels of activity.  High oil prices have stimulated expanded  drilling in the Atlanta and Dallas  Districts; Minneapolis reported  increased activity in the energy and mining sectors since the last report; and Kansas    City reported that ""energy activity remained robust.""  However, Cleveland  reported a slight decline in production of natural gas. Prices and Wages   Increases in prices of final goods  and services generally remained modest, except for food and energy.  Increases in the costs of energy and  petroleum-related materials created upward pressures on transportation costs  and the prices of some manufactured items; many producers responded by  increasing final sales prices, although limited pricing power forced some to  absorb cost increases in profit margins.   In addition, food prices continued on their pronounced upward march, and  some Districts highlighted price increases on various imported goods resulting  from the lower exchange value of the U.S. dollar.  Increases in final prices for products related  to food and energy were moderate in general, however, and they were  accompanied, in large part, by stable or declining prices for other products  and services, including various construction materials and assorted retail  merchandise.   Labor markets remained relatively  tight overall but loosened in some areas, and wage pressures were largely unchanged  from the previous survey period.  Most  reports suggested that wage increases continued at a moderate pace, with  numerical reports in the range of 3 to 4 percent on an annual basis.  Dallas  and San Francisco reported that  labor market tightness eased somewhat, relieving upward wage pressures in some  areas, but Kansas City noted that  wage pressures picked up.  Wage gains remained  especially rapid for assorted groups of workers with specialized skills used in  expanding sectors, such as engineers in the San Francisco District.",2007-11-28
47,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and based on information collected before January 7, 2008. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.   Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that economic activity increased modestly during the survey period of mid-November through December, but at a slower pace compared with the previous survey period.  Among Districts, seven reported a slight increase in activity, two reported mixed conditions, and activity in three Districts was described as slowing. Most reports on retail activity indicated subdued holiday spending and further weakness in auto sales. However, most reports on tourism spending were positive. Residential real estate conditions continued to be quite weak in all Districts.  Reports on commercial real estate activity varied, with some reports noting signs of softening demand. Manufacturing reports varied across industries, with pronounced weakness noted in housing-related industries as well as the automobile industry.  Strong export orders and increased demand in industries whose products compete against imports was reported by some Districts.  Demand for nonfinancial services remained generally positive, although some Districts commented on continuing weak demand for transportation services. Reports from banks and other financial institutions noted further declines in residential real estate lending, and lending to the commercial real estate sector was generally described as mixed.  Some Districts reported lower consumer loan volumes, whereas the volume of commercial and industrial lending varied.  Most Districts cited tighter credit standards.  Demand continued to decline for construction workers and those in housing-related industries, according to most reports, while demand generally held steady for skilled workers in nonfinancial service industries. Wage increases remained moderate overall.  Increases in prices for food, petrochemicals, metals, and energy-related inputs continued to be widely reported, and production and delivery costs for many products increased because of higher fuel prices. Producers in the agricultural sector reported generally strong demand and favorable production conditions outside of the drought-stricken areas in the Southeast.  Strong oil and gas exploration and production activity was noted by several Districts. Consumer Spending and Tourism    Reports indicate that holiday sales were generally disappointing.  Sales in the Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, New York, Richmond, and San Francisco Districts were varyingly described as lackluster, weak, below year-ago levels, or mixed.  Kansas City reported that spending was solid, but below expectations.  Sales rose modestly according to Minneapolis, Philadelphia, and St. Louis reports.  Atlanta and New York merchants noted that foreign buyers were a boost to holiday sales.  Overall, the outlook for 2008 among retail merchants was cautious.   Most Districts reported that vehicle sales for late 2007 were below year-ago levels.  However, the Minneapolis report noted strong demand from area farmers and Canadians purchasing vehicles across the border.  The Atlanta and Kansas City Districts reported that sluggish vehicle demand has resulted in unexpected inventory accumulation.  However, imports and fuel-efficient vehicles continued to sell well according to the Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas reports.  Atlanta noted that some foreign brands had turned to fleet sales to offset generally weaker retail demand.  Dealers in Philadelphia and Cleveland anticipated that sales in 2008 would be flat to lower than in 2007. Reports on tourism were mostly positive.  The Atlanta District observed that Florida businesses catering to winter visitors experienced increased demand.  The number of visitors from Europe and Canada were especially strong, and bookings for the Spring were robust. Minneapolis reported that solid snowfall in many parts of the District helped spur winter tourism activity.  Richmonds assessment of tourist activity was also generally upbeat. Tourism activity in New York City was said to have remained strong through year-end. Nonfinancial  Services    Most reports cited robust demand in several nonfinancial service industries including health care, hospitality, legal, and insurance.  According to Atlanta, the demand for engineers, particularly in petrochemical fields, was very strong.  Reports on temporary staffing services were mixed.  For instance, Dallas and Philadelphia noted that employment firms reported weaker demand for temporary workers, whereas New York and Richmond reported relatively strong demand.  Demand for transportation services was generally weak, led by lower demand from the housing sector.  Reports indicated that freight volume continued to weaken in the Atlanta and Cleveland Districts and was slow overall in the Dallas District.  Inter-modal transportation volumes were also said to be lower in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts, although Dallas noted that rail shipments were up, led by strong agricultural shipments. Manufacturing    Reports on manufacturing activity varied.  Kansas City reported that manufacturing was expanding and that manufacturers were relatively upbeat.  Cleveland reported that manufacturing output remained steady overall, whereas Dallas indicated that conditions continued to soften. New York reported that manufacturing activity appeared to weaken somewhat in early December, but noted some improvement later in the month.  Among the positive reports, San Francisco noted that production and new orders for commercial aircraft and parts remained solid, while sales of information-technology products continued to increase moderately.  Boston said that sales of aircraft equipment and pharmaceuticals continued to rise at a robust rate. Atlanta and Minneapolis noted that defense and energy-related manufacturers reported strong activity.  St. Louis and San Francisco reported that the local food production industry was expanding.  Philadelphia, Chicago, Kansas City, and Atlanta reported that many firms were expanding export activity.  In some cases, demand was also said to have increased as a result of import substitution.  For example, Chicago reported that domestic steel production was expanding, led by a moderation in imports.  Demand for equipment used in energy extraction and mining continued to be robust as well. However, according to most Districts, conditions in manufacturing industries producing construction and home-related goods remained weak.  Richmond noted weakness in demand for electronics, and San Francisco described production of industrial equipment as tepid.  In addition, auto-related production was soft according to the Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis reports. Real Estate and Construction    Conditions in most housing markets remained quite weak through year-end. The pace of sales continued to be sluggish, and inventories persisted at historically high levels according to most Districts.  Home construction levels continued to decline according to Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City, and St. Louis reports.  Reports on home prices varied.  While Dallas observed that home prices were steady, Atlanta, Cleveland, Kansas City, New York, and Richmond reported that prices declined; the Boston and San Francisco Districts said that changes in home prices were mixed.  Overall, contacts anticipate that housing markets will remain weak during the first part of 2008.  Reports on commercial real estate activity varied, with some Districts noting that activity had eased late in the year.  Contacts in the Atlanta and Boston Districts indicated that commercial markets were little changed while the Chicago, Kansas City, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, and Richmond reports suggested slower growth.  Activity was stable to increasing according to the Cleveland, Dallas, and San Francisco reports.  Vacancy rates were described as stable in the New York, Philadelphia, and Kansas City Districts, and as varied in the Richmond District.  Chicago and Minneapolis contacts noted that retail vacancies had risen.  Kansas City contacts reported that leasing activity was stable, whereas leasing activity in the Richmond, Philadelphia, and New York Districts had slowed.  Most Boston District contacts reported that rents were flat, while rents were steady to declining according to the Chicago and Kansas City reports.  New York and Richmond noted that rental rates had stabilized in the fourth quarter, whereas Dallas continued to report rising rental rates. Contacts in the Boston and Chicago Districts indicated that commercial construction activity was slowing.  Developers in the Atlanta and Richmond Districts reported smaller backlogs of projects while Cleveland District contacts said that backlogs had risen.  Most contacts anticipate a slower pace of commercial development during 2008.   Banking and Finance   Reports suggest that both business and consumer lending activity slowed in most Districts from mid-November through December.  Residential mortgage lending continued to contract in all Districts while refinancing activity varied.  For instance, Chicago and Richmond noted increased refinancing activity, but New York cited widespread declines in refinancing. Reports on commercial real estate loan demand were also mixed, although Dallas and Cleveland noted relatively healthy demand.  Most reports indicated that credit standards for most loan categories had tightened over the period.  Downward pressure on deposits was noted by Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, St Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas.  Several Districts reported declines in loan quality and increased delinquencies. Agriculture and Natural Resources    The performance of the agricultural sector across Districts was generally favorable. Upbeat conditions in Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco were attributed to a combination of higher crop prices and favorable weather.  Dallas and San Francisco reported strong domestic and global demand for their products.  Kansas City reported that strong demand and low inventories boosted prices and income for crop producers.  However, despite recent rains, conditions for drought-stricken areas in the Atlanta and Richmond Districts remained generally poor.  Activity in the energy sector increased according to the Atlanta, Dallas, Kansas City, and Minneapolis Districts.  Dallas noted a sharp rise in the Texas rig count while Kansas City cited strong drilling activity in Oklahoma and Colorado.  However, seasonal factors dampened drilling activity in the Cleveland District, and reports on coal production in the region were mixed. Atlanta indicated that Gulf Coast crude inventories were low, but new offshore platforms should help boost production in 2008.  Prices and Wages  According to most reports, businesses continued to face rising costs for food, petrochemicals, metals, and energy-related inputs.  Several Districts noted that transportation costs for most products increased.  Philadelphia reported that some firms had raised output prices in order to cover higher energy costs.  In the San Francisco District, price inflation was said to be limited in general, but significant for food and energy.  Dallas reported that high or rising input costs were squeezing margins for most industries.  Manufacturers in the New York District reported prices paid and received had increased and that this was expected to continue.  Atlanta noted that input costs continued to increase for imported goods originating in Europe or Japan because of the lower value of the dollar.  In contrast, producers of framing lumber, wallboard, and wood panels reported weak prices according to the Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Chicago reports. Reports suggest that labor markets remained relatively tight overall, and especially for skilled workers, whereas housing-related industries continued to trim payrolls.  Increases in employment costs were generally described as moderate.  Kansas City reported that overall wage pressures eased, with only the energy sector citing significant wage pressure. Philadelphia reported that labor costs continued to increase at a moderate pace while Boston, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco reported that wage pressures remained limited outside of a few sectors that continue to experience shortages of skilled labor.  Wage pressures were not significant according to the Cleveland report.",2008-01-16
48,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and based on information collected on or before February 25, 2008.  This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.   Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that economic growth has slowed since the beginning of the year.  Two-thirds of the Districts cited softening or weakening in the pace of business activity, while the others referred to subdued, slow, or modest growth.  Retail activity in most Districts was reported to be weak or softening, although tourism generally continued to expand.  Services industries in many Districts, including staffing services in Boston, port activity in New York, and truck freight volume in Cleveland, appeared to be slowing, but activity in services provided some positive news in Richmond and Dallas.  Manufacturing was said to be sluggish or to have slowed in about half the Districts, while several others indicated manufacturing results were mixed or trends were steady.  Residential real estate markets generally remained weak; reports on commercial real estate markets were somewhat mixed, but also suggest slowing, on balance, in many Districts.  Most Districts reporting on banking cite tight or tightening credit standards and stable or weaker loan demand.  Districts reporting on the agriculture and energy sectors said activity is generally strong.  Upward pressure on prices from rising materials and energy prices was noted in almost all the District reports, but Philadelphia said increases in input costs and output prices had recently become less prevalent, and San Francisco indicated pressures were limited for products other than food and energy.  By contrast, wage and salary pressures were generally said to be modest, as the hiring pace slowed in various sectors and labor markets loosened somewhat in many Districts.  Consumer Spending and Tourism Reports on retail spending were generally downbeat, although Boston, St. Louis, and Dallas described sales as mixed and Kansas City reported that consumer spending was ""largely unchanged"" since the previous survey period.  The majority of Districts characterized sales as below plan, downbeat, weak, or having softened.  Among product categories, apparel sales were soft in New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond, but strong in Boston.  Several Districts noted declines in sales of big-ticket and/or home-related items.   Districts commenting on vehicle sales described them as slow or sluggish, with little exception.  Contacts in Dallas attributed an uptick in auto sales to increased advertising and incentives.  Chicago dealerships reported some increases in used car sales in February.  Dealers in the Philadelphia District expected sales to increase later in the year, but Cleveland did not expect significant change in the upcoming months.   The majority of reports on tourism were positive, on balance, although most Districts mentioned some areas of softening.  The San Francisco District commented that while tourism in Hawaii had fallen from previous levels, activity in California remained stable, partly because of growing foreign travel resulting from the lower exchange value of the U.S. dollar.  Minneapolis reported an increase in tourism activity generally relating to winter sports.  Tourism and travel in Kansas City, Atlanta, New York, and Chicago were also mostly positive.   Nonfinancial Services  Reports from nonfinancial services industries were mixed.  Health-care services expanded in the Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts, while contacts in the St. Louis District reported a softening and plans to lay off workers.  Software and IT services respondents in Boston reported modest growth. Available reports from staffing firms pointed to mixed demand for temporary labor.  The Boston, New York, Richmond, and Atlanta Districts reported weaker staffing requests relative to a year ago; Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas reported stable to increased demand.  Boston noted increased demand from the biopharmaceutical and aerospace industries, while Dallas contacts saw an increased demand for temporary workers in IT, engineering, and oil-related services.  A large New York employment agency found that despite widely announced layoff plans at financial firms, they saw no noticeable increase in the number of job candidates.  Boston and Atlanta noted improved labor supply.   All Districts reporting on transportation services noted weaker activity in the first quarter of 2008 compared with the previous quarter.  Trucking and shipping respondents from the Richmond and Dallas Districts reported declining import volumes, which more than offset growth in exports, stimulated by the depreciation of the dollar.  However, airlines in those Districts reported higher passenger volumes since the start of the year.   Manufacturing Reports on the manufacturing sector were mixed but, on the whole, subdued.  New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas indicated that production or shipments were sluggish or falling.  Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San Francisco characterized activity as varying across industries.  Boston, Cleveland, and Chicago indicated stable levels or trends.  Only St. Louis noted a strengthening relative to prior reports.   Various Districts cited strong demand for steel, aircraft and parts, energy-related equipment, and exports, but mostly continued weak markets for products and equipment used for building and furnishing homes.  Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas indicated that automotive production and sales have been light or declining.  On the other hand, the Cleveland District saw an uptick in the production of foreign nameplates during January, and St. Louis was anticipating additional capacity and employment in automotive parts manufacturing.  Dallas reported that refining production fell in the face of weak margins.  Reports on food processing were mixed, with some Districts indicating that high prices were constraining demand, while others cited rising demand.  Boston and New York mentioned that some manufacturers are experiencing slower payments from their customers. All Districts commenting on the near-term outlook mentioned caution or concern on the part of at least some segments of manufacturing.  Boston, Philadelphia, Kansas City, and San Francisco indicated that some firms are adjusting their hiring or capital spending plans downward.  A couple of Districts mentioned risks associated with financing constraints.  For example, Chicago cited concerns on the part of the auto industry that tight credit would cause its customers to become more price-sensitive and less able to obtain car loans. Real Estate and Construction   Residential real estate markets were generally weak over the last couple of months.  Sales were low in every District with very few local exceptions.  Sales declines were particularly large in the Boston, Minneapolis, Richmond, and St. Louis Districts; at least some respondents in each of these Districts reported drops in home sales of more than 20 percent year-over-year.  Contacts in the Chicago, Kansas City, and Philadelphia Districts cited tight credit conditions as a reason for low sales; each of those Districts either reported or expected stabilization of demand for homes in the low and mid-price ranges. Districts that reported home prices all saw overall declines; one exception was the Manhattan co-op and condo market, where prices increased 5 percent compared with a year ago.  Inventories remained high as demand was still fairly low.  A few contacts in the Chicago, Cleveland, and Richmond Districts reported an increase in inquiries, although this increase in traffic had not yet translated into increased sales.  Residential construction declined or remained at low levels in most Districts.   The markets for office and retail space showed signs of a slowdown in several Districts.  Office vacancies were reported up, and leasing volumes down, in Manhattan, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Memphis, portions of Maine and Rhode Island, and Las Vegas.  Districts indicated that office vacancies held steady in Boston and the Carolinas, and were down in Philadelphia and in the Minneapolis and St. Louis Districts; however, contacts in the Boston and Philadelphia Districts and see some emerging slack.  Office rents were mixed, however, coming in about flat in greater Boston and Manhattan, either flat or down in the Richmond District, and up in Philadelphia.  Retail vacancy was reported up in the Minneapolis District and retail space demand was described as slow in the Chicago District.  Demand for industrial space was described as either ""firm"" or ""flat"" in the Districts commenting on that sector.   Sales activity in nonresidential markets was down in the Boston, Dallas, Kansas City, and Chicago Districts, with contacts citing tight credit conditions as a major factor.  Office sales activity remained strong, however, in the major cities of the New York District and in the San Francisco District.  Eight of the twelve Districts reported that nonresidential construction activity was slow; countering these reports, the Cleveland, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts indicated that construction remained strong.   Banking and Finance Reports on loan demand for commercial, industrial, and residential mortgage loans varied across Districts.  Overall loan demand was flat in San Francisco and weakened in the Kansas City, St. Louis, Dallas, New York, and Richmond Districts.  Consumer lending was flat or declining in the St. Louis, Chicago, and Cleveland Districts.  Commercial and industrial loan demand was mixed in San Francisco and remained stable or declined in the Kansas City, St. Louis, Dallas, New York, and Richmond Districts.  By contrast, the Chicago and Cleveland Districts reported increased business lending.  Even as loan demand for new residential mortgages remained sluggish or declined, lower interest rates prompted increases in refinancing of existing mortgages in a number of Districts, including San Francisco, St. Louis, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Cleveland, and Chicago.  Cleveland cited a small rise in delinquencies, especially for real estate loans, and Atlanta reported an increase in mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures.  New York, on the other hand, saw a rise in delinquencies for all loan categories except residential mortgages, which were unchanged.  Tight credit standards were reported in the Atlanta, San Francisco, Kansas City, St. Louis, Chicago, Dallas, Richmond, and New York Districts.  Kansas City indicated a worsening of overall loan quality, Chicago reported a deterioration of consumer loan quality, and Cleveland also saw a decline in credit quality for business customers and consumers.  By contrast, Dallas reported sound credit quality.   Agriculture and Natural Resources  The Chicago, San Francisco, Minneapolis, St. Louis, and Dallas Districts reported strong conditions in the agriculture sector, including high prices for winter wheat, corn, soybeans, sorghum, and hogs, and increased production of some crops.  By contrast, Atlanta and Richmond indicated that although recent rain had improved conditions in Maryland and Virginia, drought conditions persisted in other areas, and range pasture conditions remained poor.  Farm incomes and/or value of production rose in several Districts during 2007, although Kentucky farmers saw no change and Tennessee farmers saw declines compared to 2006.  Increases in input costs, including prices of fuel, fertilizer, and feed were mentioned by Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco as potentially affecting future production and incomes; Chicago and Dallas also cited recent weather-related problems that threaten production this spring.  Increases in the value of farmland were reported by Chicago and Minneapolis.  All Districts reporting on energy cited robust levels of activity and steady or higher prices; in addition, Kansas City and Cleveland mentioned increases in hiring. However, Dallas noted that drilling had flattened domestically and declined in the Gulf of Mexico, leaving activity outside of North America to drive future growth, while Kansas City, Cleveland, and Minneapolis expected exploration and capital spending to increase going forward.  Rates for durable equipment, and drilling and evaluation services were reported to be flat to declining.  However, price pressures, regulatory costs, and tightening credit were mentioned as providing possible future impediments to increased production. Prices and Wages Business contacts in many Districts cited price pressures from vendors and mixed success in raising their own prices to recoup the increased costs.  Manufacturing contacts in the Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts pointed to rising costs for raw materials or other inputs, while manufacturing firms in the New York District reported more widespread increases in prices paid ""than in well over a year.""  By contrast, Philadelphia noted somewhat less prevalent increases in input costs and output prices in February than in January, except for increased mention of rising prices for imported goods.  Upward pressures on input costs from high or rising energy prices were frequently cited, which also translated into increased transportation and shipping costs.  Price increases for metals, petrochemicals, and food were also mentioned often. The San Francisco District, however, indicated that price pressures were limited except for food and energy.  Firms' ability to pass along cost increases by raising selling prices varied.  The Boston District noted that retail contacts were passing some price increases on to customers, and some manufacturers were raising selling prices to partially offset rising costs; half the manufacturers contacted in the Cleveland District had raised prices or added surcharges since the previous report.  The Dallas and Atlanta Districts reported that some firms raised prices but others were constrained by competitive pressures; Chicago indicated that contacts outside of construction and retail were passing cost increases along to customers. In the Kansas City District, factory goods' prices had escalated, but retail prices were mostly stable. Most Districts indicated that contacted businesses reported limited wage pressures, moderate wage increases, and some loosening of labor markets.  While Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco noted short supplies of selected types of skilled labor relative to demand, they and the New York, Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts cited pullbacks in the pace of hiring by some firms.  Furthermore, several Districts, including New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Atlanta, reported increased prevalence of layoffs, reductions in work hours, or hiring freezes.",2008-03-05
49,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and based on information collected on or before April 7, 2008.  This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.   Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that economic conditions have weakened since the last report. Nine Districts noted slowing in the pace of economic activity, while the remaining three--Boston, Cleveland, and Richmond--described activity as mixed or steady.  Consumer spending was characterized as softening across most of the country, with some Districts reporting year-over-year declines in retail and/or auto sales.  In contrast, tourism was generally described as strong, with a number of Districts noting particular strength in foreign visitors.  Reports on nonfinancial services varied by District: demand for transportation services was generally characterized as weak, while business and health services continued to expand; other service industries were said to be mixed.  Trends in manufacturing also varied across Districts.  Reports on real estate and construction were generally anemic for the residential sector; activity in the commercial sector has slowed.  Financial institutions in many Districts indicated some deceleration in consumer loan demand, tightening in lending standards, and deterioration in asset quality.  Most Districts reported improved conditions in the agricultural sector and robust activity in the energy industry.   Labor markets were mostly described as weakening since the last report, though a few Districts reported ongoing shortages of skilled workers and some Districts noted wage pressures.  Increases in input costs were widespread, accompanied by somewhat smaller rises in selling prices.  Consumer Spending and Tourism Consumer spending weakened in most, but not all, Districts since the last report.  In particular, automobile sales were generally reported to be flat or declining.  Vehicle sales were described as unchanged or falling in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Dallas Districts and were characterized as weak in the Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts.  However, Kansas City reported that auto sales rebounded in March, though they remained lower than a year earlier.  Non-auto retailers reported that sales were sluggish or declining in ten Districts.  Elsewhere, Boston noted mixed sales trends, and New York reported a modest pickup since the last report.  Chicago, San Francisco, and, to a lesser extent, Philadelphia noted relative strength in demand for luxury goods.   Retail inventories were generally reported to be steady or rising.  Automobile inventories were said to be accumulating in the Philadelphia and Atlanta Districts.  Among non-auto retailers, despite weakness in sales, only a few reported any notable inventory accumulation; Atlanta cited some increase in inventories, while the Richmond and San Francisco Districts noted that some inventory accumulation has prompted retailers to cancel orders.   Despite the general weakness in consumer spending, tourism was generally described as robust, with that strength, in a number of instances, attributed to international visitors.  The Boston, New York, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts reported strong tourism activity, while the Richmond and Chicago Districts described that sector as mixed, with pockets of strength.  San Francisco indicated mixed but generally weak tourism activity.  Reports from Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, and Minneapolis specifically cited foreign visitors as a source of strength.  Nonfinancial Services Activity in the service sector was mixed across Districts and across industries since the last report.  Looking at the service sector in broad terms, Boston, Richmond, and Minneapolis reported some revenue growth; New York and St. Louis noted some softening; and San Francisco saw some deceleration.  A number of Districts reported weakness in transportation services: New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Dallas described shipping and freight activity as sluggish or weakening, with New York attributing the softening to declining import volume at the port.  Richmond ports also noted weakening in imports but robust export activity.  There were scattered reports of continued expansion in some other service industries, such as business services (Boston, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Minneapolis) and health care (Chicago, San Francisco).   Manufacturing Manufacturing activity was varied, with some Districts reporting a slight increase in activity, some indicating weaker activity, and several noting that activity was mixed or had held steady. Chicago, Boston, and Richmond reported that activity was rising, but not substantially, while New York, Kansas City, Philadelphia and Dallas all reported that activity had weakened. St. Louis and Cleveland said that activity had held steady, while Atlanta, Minneapolis and San Francisco saw activity as mixed. Demand was reported as strong for aerospace, aircraft, and defense goods, as well as for steel and food. Automakers increased production modestly in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts, but vehicle production declined in the Atlanta district. The Philadelphia District found that that demand for metals and machinery had increased.  Many Districts cited strong exports generally.  Most Districts saw a continued slide in the demand for goods related to residential construction. Excess capacity led to production declines in the high-tech industry in the Dallas District, and Chicago reported weak demand for heavy equipment. Uncertainty about economic conditions is leading to a varied, but generally subdued, outlook for manufacturers.  Real Estate and Construction Housing markets and home construction remained sluggish throughout most of the nation, though there were few signs of any quickening in the pace of deterioration.  Ongoing weakness in housing markets, in general, was reported in almost all Districts.  Sales activity was generally reported to be declining in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco Districts, while Kansas City and Chicago noted slack demand and excess inventories.  On the other hand, the Cleveland District saw some pickup in activity, while Richmond and Atlanta reported some pockets of improvement; Boston, Atlanta, and Chicago cited some recent pickup in traffic or buyer inquiries.  New residential construction was reported to have remained at depressed levels, and none of the Districts reported any pickup since the last report.    Declines or downward pressures in selling prices were specifically reported in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts.  In particular, New York and San Francisco noted some incipient price declines in areas that had previously shown resilience--respectively, New York City and the Pacific Northwest, as well as Utah.  On the other hand, the Cleveland District noted some stabilization in home prices.   Commercial real estate markets were generally reported to be steady or softening in most areas.  Weaker conditions in the rental market were reported in eight Districts: New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco.  On the other hand, the leasing market was found to be steady in Boston, Kansas City and Dallas.  Reports on commercial development were mixed with activity having weakened in the Philadelphia, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts, but having increased in the Cleveland, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts.   St. Louis characterized commercial construction as strong.  However, sales of commercial properties were generally indicated to be sluggish, while prices were said to be under downward pressure.  The Boston, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts all reported weakness in commercial real estate sales and prices.   Banking and Finance Banks reported mixed trends in lending activity, with fairly widespread slowing in the consumer segment but some stabilization, at low levels, in residential mortgage activity.   Overall lending activity was reported to have increased in the Philadelphia, Richmond and St. Louis Districts, but to have declined in the New York, Chicago, Kansas City and San Francisco Districts.  Dallas described lending activity as steady but soft.  Lending activity for new home mortgages, though generally characterized as sluggish, was reported to have stabilized in the New York, Cleveland, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts.  Consumer loan demand, however, weakened in a number of Districts: New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City.   Credit quality was reported to have deteriorated, on balance, since the last report.  Increased delinquency rates were noted by New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland, while Kansas City reported that loan quality remained lower than a year ago.  Widespread tightening in credit standards was reported, especially on residential and commercial real estate loans.  In general, banks were reported to be tightening credit standards in the New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco Districts. In addition, Boston noted that standards remain tight on commercial mortgages, while Philadelphia indicated that banks are limiting lending in this category.  Richmond indicated tighter standards on residential mortgages.    Agriculture and Natural Resources  Agricultural reports were generally upbeat, with most respondents citing improved growing conditions and favorable pricing.  Although drought conditions continued to persist in some areas of the Atlanta and Richmond Districts, soil moisture was adequate for spring planting, in part, due to increases in precipitation in March and early April.  Reports from the Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis Districts indicated that cool temperatures, dry conditions, or flooding toward the end of March damaged some winter crops and delayed field preparations for spring plantings. Farmers in the Chicago, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and St. Louis Districts all reported plans to shift production away from corn toward soybeans in 2008, in part, because of favorable soybean prices and elevated corn production costs.  Some farms in the San Francisco District expressed concern over prolonged drought conditions and pending cuts in water deliveries.  Dairy and livestock producers in the Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts expressed concern that increased feed costs had reduced margins.   Districts reporting on energy continued to see robust levels of activity and steady to increasing prices.  In the Dallas District, drilling remained strong and natural gas production has continued to increase.  In the Minneapolis District, expansion of the mining industry was underway, while oil and gas exploration remained robust.  In general, contacts contended that increased demand for energy was expected to continue to boost activity and prices.  Labor Markets Despite some variation across Districts, employment levels appeared to be little changed, on balance, from recent months.  Some weakening in the job market was reported in the New York, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Districts.  Cleveland reported flat employment levels, while Richmond indicated mixed trends. Boston and Kansas City indicated modest increases in employment, with some deceleration indicated in the latter.  Firms in the Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Minneapolis Districts reported layoffs, reductions in work hours, or hiring freezes in response to current or expected slowing in economic activity. Despite the general softening in their markets overall, Atlanta and Chicago noted scattered shortages of skilled workers in various service industries. Dallas reported relatively tight labor market conditions overall and cited shortages of managers and engineers, as well as farm workers.  Staffing and temp agencies reported mixed trends in labor demand: New York, Richmond, and Chicago reported some softening, whereas Cleveland and Dallas note some pickup.  In the financial services industry, some weakening in employment trends was reported in the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Districts, and San Francisco noted job losses in firms servicing the real estate industry.   Prices Business contacts across all Districts continued to report increases in input costs and output prices.  In particular, price increases were consistently reported for food products, fuel and energy products, and many raw materials.  More specifically, increases in the price of chemicals, metals, plastics and other petroleum-based products were commonly cited.  Most manufacturers have or are planning to increase prices in response to rising input costs, while the response of service firms has been more mixed, in part due to differences in competitive pressures.  On balance, input costs have risen more rapidly than output prices, putting pressure on margins for many firms.  Most Districts reported little change in retail price inflation, though Richmond and San Francisco noted some moderation. Most business contacts reported that wages were unchanged or were increasing moderately in all Districts.  Business contacts in the Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Philadelphia, and San Francisco Districts indicated that there has been some upward wage pressure for skilled labor in some sectors that continue to experience shortages.",2008-04-16
50,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and based on information collected on or before June 2, 2008.  This document  summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the  Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve  officials.  Reports from the  Federal Reserve Districts suggest that economic activity remained generally weak  in late April and May.  Three Districts  described economic activity as softer, weaker, or lower, with an additional  four Districts reporting slower, sluggish, or modest economic growth.  The remaining five Districts of Philadelphia,  Cleveland, Atlanta,  St. Louis, and San    Francisco described activity as stable or little  changed in recent weeks.   Consumer spending  slowed since the last report as incomes were pinched by rising energy and food  prices.  Higher energy prices also appeared  to damp domestic tourism.  Reports on  nonfinancial services varied across Districts and industries.  Manufacturing activity was generally soft in  recent weeks, with weak demand for housing-related and some other products but  with increasing demand for exports.   Residential real estate markets remained weak across most Districts.  Commercial real estate conditions varied  across Districts, as did reports on nonresidential construction activity.  Lending activity also varied across Districts  and market segments, though tighter credit standards were reported for most  loan categories.  Districts reporting on  the agriculture and energy sectors noted improved crop conditions and increased  drilling and extraction activity.    Reports of higher  input costs were widespread.   Manufacturing contacts in several Districts noted some ability to pass  along higher costs to customers.   Retailers reported mixed results with respect to raising final goods  prices.  In most Districts, wage  pressures were reported as moderate or limited for all but a few skilled-labor  positions, as hiring activity remained spotty in most Districts. Consumer Spending and Tourism Consumer spending slowed further since the  last report.  Contacts in several  Districts said rising energy and food prices contributed to softer sales in  other categories.  The overall pace of  retail sales moderated in the Districts of Philadelphia, Richmond,  Atlanta, St.    Louis, Minneapolis,  Dallas, and San    Francisco, and was level in Cleveland,  Chicago, and Kansas    City.  Retail  sales reports were mixed in Boston  and New York.  According to contacts, retail inventory  levels were generally higher in the Atlanta District and among some types of  stores in San Francisco; some  establishments in the New York, St.    Louis, and Richmond Districts expressed concerns about  inventory levels.  In the Boston District  retail inventories were stable.   Employment was on the whole unchanged at Boston District retailers,  whereas retailers in the Cleveland District said they were only hiring for new  stores, and Richmond District retail contacts reported job cuts. Reports  on overall sales of automobiles and light trucks were weak, with several  Districts indicating that sales of trucks and SUVs declined.  Although dealers generally struggled to move  vehicles off of their lots, contacts in the Richmond,  Atlanta, and Chicago Districts  reported solid sales of hybrid and other fuel-efficient vehicles.   Tourist activity  varied across Districts.  New    York contacts said that tourist activity had  softened, noting lower attendance at Broadway theaters. San    Francisco reported weaker hotel bookings in Southern   California and in Hawaii,  but record hotel occupancy rates in parts of Alaska.  Higher gasoline prices appeared to weaken  tourism activity in the Chicago District, but increased activity at some  resorts in the Richmond District as families took vacations closer to home.  International visitors boosted tourism  activity in the Atlanta and Dallas  Districts. Nonfinancial Services Reports from nonfinancial services  industries varied among Districts.  New    York and Minneapolis  reported weaker business conditions while contacts in the Richmond District  reported slower revenue growth, except in telecommunications.  Demand growth for service providers slowed in  the San Francisco District.  Demand at  services businesses in Boston and Chicago,  however, was mixed and the pace of business spending was little changed in the  Chicago District.  Meanwhile, demand in  the service sector generally strengthened in St. Louis  and Kansas City.  Staffing agencies in the Richmond District  reported somewhat weaker demand overall, while staffing agencies in the Chicago  and Dallas Districts said that demand was stable.  In transportation services, intermodal  shipments edged down in the Atlanta  and Dallas Districts, while freight service growth was flat in the Cleveland  District.  Reports on air travel remained  strong despite route reductions, according to contacts in the Kansas City  Districts.    In service sector  labor markets, Chicago reported a  slower pace of hiring in recent weeks and Minneapolis  reported that employment in professional services companies decreased from a  year ago and is expected to remain flat over the next year.  Cleveland  and Richmond reported little net  change in services employment, while contacts in the St. Louis District said  that expansion at firms in some services industries will lead to additional  hiring.  Boston  and Dallas noted tight labor  markets for some skilled workers.  Manufacturing Manufacturing activity was generally soft  since the last report.  Boston,   New York, Richmond,  Atlanta, and Chicago  reported that activity had weakened, although St. Louis,  Minneapolis, Kansas  City, and Dallas indicated that  activity had increased slightly.  Philadelphia,  Cleveland, and San    Francisco described factory activity as nearly  steady.  Reports of softer demand for  housing-related products continued to be widespread.  Many Districts cited higher production costs  and cuts in employment that contacts attributed to slumping home sales and  construction.  The Atlanta  and Chicago Districts indicated that automotive production or sales fell short  of expectations, while the Cleveland District saw an uptick in the production  of domestic nameplates.  Reports on food  processing were mixed with some Districts indicating that higher prices had  constrained demand, while others noted rising demand.    Industries  demonstrating increased activity were boosted, in part, by a strong overseas  market.  Cleveland,  Atlanta, Chicago,  and Dallas reported that the demand  for steel was strong.  The output of energy-related  equipment increased in the Boston,  Cleveland, Atlanta,  and Dallas Districts, while strong sales of farm equipment boosted demand for  manufacturers of heavy equipment according to Chicago  and San Francisco.  Dallas  also reported strong demand for transportation equipment to supply defense and  aircraft industries. Real Estate and  Construction Residential real  estate markets were generally weak across most of the nation.  District reports indicated flat or declining  home sales in Boston, New York,  Cleveland, St.    Louis, and Dallas,  and contacts in Philadelphia did  not expect housing activity to expand strongly this year.  Contacts in San    Francisco reported that housing markets remained  exceptionally weak, although a few reports pointed to some recent pickup in  home sales attributed to increased affordability.  Scattered reports from Philadelphia  and Kansas City indicated seasonal  improvements.  Inventory levels of new  and existing homes remained high or were rising in New    York, Philadelphia,  Cleveland, Richmond,  and San Francisco.  Home sales prices decreased somewhat in Boston,  Atlanta, Kansas  City, and San Francisco, but  remained relatively stable in Richmond  and Chicago.  The New York  and Chicago Districts noted that some potential buyers had difficulty in  obtaining financing.  Residential  construction declined in Chicago, St.    Louis, and Minneapolis,  but was flat to slightly higher in parts of the Atlanta District and spiked in  areas of the Dallas District where demand for apartments was solid.  Homebuilders in Cleveland  expected no improvement in the housing industry for the remainder of 2008, and Chicago  reported that limited credit availability for new developments had caused many  builders to suffer losses on existing projects.   Richmond and San    Francisco noted an increase in home foreclosures.   Commercial real  estate conditions varied in April and May, with some Districts reporting that  activity had softened.  Leasing activity  eased in Boston, New York,  Philadelphia, Richmond,  and San Francisco.  Minneapolis,  however, reported that market activity was up modestly, while activity was  mixed across the St. Louis District.   Vacancy rates edged higher in Boston, Kansas  City, and San Francisco, as well as  in pockets of the Richmond and St.  Louis Districts.  Absorption was negative  in Boston and in Minneapolis  for both office and manufacturing space.   Overall rents were on the rise in New York,  but were stable or beginning to slip in Boston,  Philadelphia, Richmond,  and Kansas City.  Sales trended downward according to the New    York, Philadelphia,  and Kansas City Districts.   Reports on  nonresidential construction activity were mixed.  Contacts from Chicago  and Minneapolis saw slight  increases in activity.  Philadelphia,  Cleveland, Richmond,  Atlanta, and Dallas,  however, reported easing or weak levels of construction.  A number of Districts--Cleveland,  Richmond, Chicago,  and Dallas--reported that  obtaining financing remained difficult for some projects. Banking and Finance Reports on lending activity varied across  Districts, although reports of softening in the consumer segment  persisted.  Overall loan demand cooled in  Richmond, Atlanta,  St. Louis, and San    Francisco, while Philadelphia  and Cleveland saw a modest increase.  New York reported little change  in demand across all categories, while lending activity in Chicago  was mixed.  Residential lending activity  remained generally weak in Richmond,  Atlanta, and Chicago.  In contrast, demand picked up in Philadelphia,  Cleveland, Kansas  City, and Dallas, but was about the  same in St. Louis.  Commercial and industrial lending activity  was mostly unchanged or declining in New York,  St. Louis, Kansas  City, and San Francisco, while Philadelphia,  Richmond, and Chicago  saw slight increases. Atlanta  reported commercial lending activity as mixed.   The  New York, Philadelphia,  and Cleveland Districts reported increases in overall delinquencies, with  respondents in New York  indicating a notable rise in late payments for consumer loans.  Credit quality deteriorated further in San    Francisco, but began to stabilize in Chicago and  Dallas.  Contacts in Kansas    City and Dallas  expected loan quality to deteriorate going forward. All Districts reporting on  credit standards noted further tightening for consumer, residential, and  commercial loans.  Agriculture and Natural Resources Despite less-than-ideal weather, crop  conditions generally improved for most reporting Districts.  Reports from the Richmond,  Chicago, St.    Louis, and Minneapolis Districts indicated that the  combination of cooler-than-normal weather and wet conditions delayed planting  and development of many crops.  St.    Louis said that planting of major crops was behind its  five-year average pace, while Minneapolis  noted delayed planting and development of corn and soybeans. Richmond  and Chicago reported that some crops  would require replanting, although Chicago District contacts expected small  losses in yields.  Despite weather  delays, Kansas City noted that corn  planting was almost complete, soybean planting was in progress, and the winter  wheat crop was in good condition.   Chicago and Dallas cited high input costs and price movements for corn  as factors leading farmers to shift production away from corn towards soybeans.  Dairy and livestock producers in the Chicago  and Kansas City Districts voiced concerns that rising feed costs were eating  into profit margins.    Activity  in the energy industry remained strong according to reports from the Minneapolis,   Kansas City, Dallas,  and San Francisco Districts.  Cleveland  said that energy producers reported a pickup in oil and gas drilling, and Minneapolis  indicated that robust oil and gas exploration and production continued in their  District.  Kansas    City noted that the number of active drilling rigs  surged since the last survey period and remained well above year-ago levels.  San Francisco  reported that oil and natural gas extraction expanded further in response to  growing demand, but that activity had been constrained slightly by a shortage  of equipment and materials. In contrast, Dallas  noted that high oil and natural gas prices had pushed drilling to the highest  level in 20 years without any shortages of equipment and services to date. Prices  and Wages Business contacts in most  Districts reported increases in input prices since the last report, especially  prices for energy, petroleum derivatives, metals, plastics, chemicals, and  food.  Manufacturing contacts in several  Districts reported some ability to pass along the higher costs to customers and  contacts in the Cleveland District noted that they are considering additional  price increases in the near future if input costs continue to rise.  On the other hand, contacts in the Cleveland,  Atlanta, and Chicago Districts  noted falling or stable prices for certain goods related to the construction  industry.  Retail price reports were  mixed, with contacts in the San Francisco District reporting subdued price  pressures for most products save food and energy-intensive goods.  Contacts in the New York District reported  steady retail prices with somewhat more aggressive discounting.  However, retail contacts in the Richmond  and Kansas City Districts reported higher prices, while retailers in the  Chicago District reported increased pressure to pass along higher food and  energy prices.  Contacts in the Kansas    City and Dallas Districts cited expectations for  higher retail prices in the near future.   Business contacts  in most Districts reported moderate or limited wage growth in response to some  loosening of labor market conditions.   Contacts in the Boston, Chicago,   Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts  noted wage pressures for certain skilled labor positions in industries facing  worker shortages.",2008-06-11
51,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and based on information collected on or before July 14, 2008.  This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.   Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that the pace of economic activity slowed somewhat since the last report.  Five eastern Districts noted a weakening or softening in their overall economies, while Chicago characterized its economy as sluggish and Kansas City noted a moderation in growth.  St. Louis said activity was stable and San Francisco reported little or no growth.  Cleveland and Minneapolis reported slight increases in economic activity, while Dallas described growth as steady and moderate.  Consumer spending was reported as sluggish or slowing in nearly all Districts, although tax rebate checks boosted sales for some items.  Tourist activity was mixed, with residents in several Districts choosing to vacation closer to home due to high gasoline prices.  The demand for services was also mixed across Districts, with strength in the IT and health care industries offsetting some weakness in other service sectors.  Manufacturing activity declined in many Districts, although demand for exports remained generally high.  Residential real estate markets declined or were still weak across most of the country.  Commercial real estate activity also slowed or remained sluggish in a majority of Districts, although a few Districts noted slight improvement.  In banking, loan growth was generally reported to be restrained, with residential real estate lending and consumer lending showing more weakness than commercial lending.  Districts reporting on agricultural activity said conditions were mixed, based largely on how June precipitation affected them.  Districts reporting on the energy sector said it continued to strengthen.  All reporting Districts characterized overall price pressures as elevated or increasing.  Input prices continued to rise, particularly for fuel, other petroleum-based materials, metals, food, and chemicals.  Retail price inflation varied across the country, with some Districts reporting increases but others noting some stability, at least for the present.  Wage pressures were generally limited in most Districts, as labor market demand was soft except for highly skilled workers and in the energy sector. Consumer Spending and Tourism Consumer spending was reported as mixed, weak, or slowing in nearly all Districts since the last report, although tax rebate checks boosted sales for some items, especially electronics.  Cleveland was an exception to the trend, characterizing sales as stable to improving outside of the grocery sector.  Sales at discount stores were also reported as growing in the Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, and New York reported brisk sales in New York City.  However, sales at most other types of stores, especially for discretionary and housing-related items, were typically characterized as weak or falling, and restaurant sales were also reported as slow in the Philadelphia and Minneapolis Districts.  The outlook for retail activity was also generally downbeat, with expectations ""subdued"" among Atlanta District contacts and ""grim"" among Dallas District contacts.  Despite sluggish overall sales, inventories were reported as largely satisfactory in most Districts. Reports on automobile sales were almost uniformly weak across Districts.  Sales were especially poor for large vehicles such as trucks, SUVs, and some minivans.  Indeed, auto dealers in the San Francisco District were increasingly reluctant to accept trade-ins of trucks and SUVs due to a lack of a wholesale market for these vehicles.  Demand for small fuel-efficient and foreign vehicles was reported to be solid or increasing in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts.  Dallas reported that consumers were paying sticker prices for such vehicles, and that they were in short supply.  Tourist activity was mixed across Districts.  Contacts in the Philadelphia and Chicago Districts reported weakness, and San Francisco said travel to Hawaii declined noticeably.  Atlanta also noted increased hotel cancellations and shorter trip durations, although convention business remained strong.  By contrast, tourist activity to mountain areas of the Richmond, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts was characterized as stronger, which some contacts attributed in part to more residents vacationing close to home due to high gasoline prices.  New York also reported strong tourism activity in New York City, including for Broadway shows and at Manhattan hotels. Nonfinancial Services The demand for services was mixed among the various Districts, with strength in the IT and health care industries offsetting some weakness in other service sectors.  Advertising and marketing firms in the Boston District experienced robust demand from the tourism and retail industries, and St. Louis reported the addition of two new call centers in the area.  Dallas noted particularly strong demand for accounting, energy, engineering, and IT services.  On the negative side, New York, Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco reported services activity as mixed or decreasing.  San Francisco noted ""grim"" conditions for real estate services such as title insurance, and some service firms in the New York District expressed caution about hiring due to ongoing turmoil in the financial industry.  In transportation services, New York, Atlanta, and Dallas reported weaker activity due to higher fuel costs, while Cleveland said activity remained unchanged and Richmond indicated an increase in shipping volume.  New York said fuel, as opposed to labor, was now the number one cost for trucking firms and that most surcharges were considered inadequate to defray the escalated costs.  Cleveland reported that many trucking firms had reduced capital spending, with little change expected in coming months.  Atlanta and Dallas noted a decline in auto and construction materials shipments.  Most services contacts expected flat activity heading forward.   Manufacturing  Manufacturing activity declined or remained weak in most Districts, although Cleveland, St. Louis, and San Francisco reported stable or slightly increasing activity.  Many Districts reported a decline in production of housing-related goods, such as construction equipment, wood products, home furnishings, and HVAC units.  The Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts all reported declines in auto manufacturing activity.  However, St. Louis noted a slight rise in demand for parts of small and hybrid-type cars.  An equipment producer in the Richmond District cited reduced sales due to interrupted shipments caused by higher gas prices and restrictive truck schedules.  On the positive side, producers of energy equipment saw increased demand in several Districts, and Minneapolis noted a rise in orders for wind turbine parts.  San Francisco said that food manufacturers continued to operate at or near peak capacity due to persistently high demand.  Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City reported continued high demand for exports.  Dallas noted strong overseas sales of high-tech products in Asia, but cited weak demand in Western Europe.  Some manufacturers in the Boston District cited examples of robust demand in foreign markets, while others said foreign demand growth may be slowing.  Manufacturers in several Districts anticipated further factory weakness in the near future.  While most Districts expected stable capital spending heading forward, a few noted manufacturers' plans to reevaluate based on current economic conditions.   Real Estate and Construction Residential real estate markets declined or were still weak across most of the country.  Slower home sales were reported in the Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and St. Louis Districts.  Cleveland reported flat to declining sales, while sales remained sluggish in the Kansas City and New York Districts--especially at the high end--and were below year-ago levels in the Minneapolis District.  New York also reported a drop in Manhattan condo and co-op transactions.  Inventories of unsold homes or condos were reported as higher or excessive in several Districts, but Dallas noted a continued decline in inventories, especially at the low end.  Home prices continued to decline in most Districts, and increased use of incentives and discounting was noted in several Districts.  San Francisco noted particularly sharp declines in home prices in areas of California, Arizona, and Nevada that have experienced large increases in foreclosures.  Atlanta said home prices dropped across the board.  On the other hand, home prices were said to be holding up in the Dallas District and were little changed in the Kansas City District.  Difficulties obtaining mortgage financing were reported in the New York and Chicago Districts.  All Districts reporting on single-family construction said activity continued to decline, and builders in the Philadelphia District noted a rising number of cancellations.  The decline in new construction accelerated in some areas of the Chicago District. Commercial real estate activity weakened or remained sluggish in a majority of Districts, although Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Kansas City noted some improvement.  Boston characterized sentiment in the sector as ""decidedly morose,"" and industrial markets were especially weak in that District.  Office market conditions in the Richmond District continued to weaken and were ""bleak"" in the Washington, DC area.  Vacancy rates increased in the Philadelphia and Atlanta Districts, and were up noticeably in both Midtown and Downtown Manhattan, according to contacts in the New York District.  Office rents remained steady in the Philadelphia District, and were little changed in the Boston District after taking concessions into account.  More positively, contacts in the Minneapolis District noted rent increases and positive absorption in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area office market.  Districts reporting on nonresidential construction generally noted sluggishness, which contacts in the Chicago and Kansas City Districts attributed in part to prohibitively high construction costs.  Contractors in the Cleveland District were also worried about cuts but reported strong backlogs and a steady flow of inquiries.  Contacts in many Districts also cited tightened financing as a constraint.  San Francisco noted particularly steep drops in commercial construction in the San Diego area.  Retail space was described as overbuilt in the Boston and Chicago Districts.   Banking and Finance Loan growth was generally reported to be restrained across the country, with residential real estate lending and consumer lending showing more weakness than commercial lending.  Overall loan demand was reported to have weakened in the New York, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, and was described as sluggish in the Philadelphia District.  St. Louis reported slightly positive overall loan demand.  A number of Districts reported sluggish growth or slowing demand for residential real estate loans, and San Francisco described demand for such loans as very weak.  Consumer loan demand was reported to have declined in the New York, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts, and grew more slowly in the Philadelphia District.  Reports on business lending were generally more upbeat.  However, slight to moderate declines in business lending were reported in the New York, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts.  On the funding side, Dallas described competition for deposits as very tough, but Cleveland indicated that core deposits at smaller banks were stable to increasing as a result of a flight to safety by investors. Most Districts reported a further tightening of credit standards, especially for residential real estate and construction loans.  Dallas reported that lenders were tightening non-price terms and boosting loan spreads in response to increases in their cost of capital.  Tighter standards for construction loans were reported in the Atlanta and Chicago Districts, and San Francisco indicated that credit standards remained quite restrictive for both residential real estate and construction loans.  Tighter standards for business loans were reported in three Districts, but banks in the Atlanta District were reported to be competing more intensely for business customers with good credit histories.  Kansas City and Boston reported that tightened standards were especially prevalent on commercial real estate loans.  Among the Districts that commented on bank loan quality, some deterioration was reported, including in the Philadelphia, Richmond and San Francisco Districts.  New York reported increased delinquencies on consumer and residential real estate loans, and San Francisco indicated that declines in loan quality were greatest for real estate loans and construction loans.  In the Dallas District, contacts had not yet observed a significant decline in loan quality but expected deterioration in coming months, especially for residential real estate and consumer loans.  Agriculture and Natural Resources Agricultural conditions were mixed across Districts following June precipitation, while high input costs trimmed profits.  Drought conditions eased in the Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts with increased rainfall.  However, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City reported that cool, wet weather delayed corn and soybean development, and Chicago cited major crop losses due to flooding.  Heavy rains also delayed the winter wheat harvests in the Richmond, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts, although initial reports indicated average or above average wheat yields.  San Francisco noted robust agricultural export activity, but wildfires hindered growing conditions in that District.  Most Districts reported concerns about higher input costs.  Kansas City attributed slightly lower farm income expectations and increased agricultural loan demand to these higher costs.  Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas also indicated that livestock producers were struggling with higher feed costs. Energy activity strengthened further with rising energy prices.  Oil and natural gas drilling remained strong in the Cleveland, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco Districts, with expectations of further exploration.  In the search for new energy sources, Dallas noted increased drilling activity toward unconventional natural gas sources, and Kansas City cited rising interest in tapping shale oil deposits.  Minneapolis stated that wind farm development continued, although ethanol production slowed with higher corn prices.  Mining activity increased in the Cleveland and Minneapolis Districts.  Cleveland indicated that equipment costs were rising, while the lack of equipment constrained oil and gas production in the Kansas City District. Prices and Wages All reporting Districts characterized overall price pressures as elevated or increasing.  Input prices continued to rise, particularly for fuel, other petroleum-based materials, metals, food, and chemicals.  Chicago said the rate of growth in steel prices had flattened, but overall levels remained high.  Construction industry contacts in the Cleveland District noted rising prices for all types of products, including concrete, shingles, and steel.  Boston reported that contacts were anticipating further price increases in oil derivatives, shipping, and travel.  Many Districts reported on manufacturers' plans to raise selling prices as a result of higher input prices, with several commenting on fears of a corresponding decrease in customer demand and overall sales volume.  Several firms in the Philadelphia District indicated that sluggish demand has made it difficult to raise prices, and Atlanta District businesses were hesitant to pass-through increases due to a reduction in discretionary consumer spending.  One producer in the Richmond District indicated that his company would attempt to pass along price increases to customers but it may not be enough to offset cost increases.  Retail prices increased in several Districts, including in the Kansas City District-which reported an increase in hotel, restaurant, and resort prices-and in the Chicago District, where retailers said they raised selling prices in response to higher wholesale prices.  On the other hand, New York and Cleveland reported relatively stable retail prices.  San Francisco also reported that final prices for many retail items were stable or down, partly due to extensive discounting, although some contacts noted that pressures were likely to increase in coming months.  One major retail chain in the New York District said that while costs under existing contract were not up substantially, some escalation in prices was expected within the next year.   Most Districts reported labor markets as unchanged or slightly weaker compared with the last survey period, and that wage pressures were generally modest.  Demand for labor remained high for skilled workers in most industries, while several Districts reported widespread weakness in the financial services, auto, and construction industries.  Contacts in the Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts reported very little upward wage pressures, with the exception of the energy and skilled labor markets.  San Francisco noted some downward movement in wages for construction, finance, real estate, and retail jobs.  But Boston and Dallas said more workers were requesting wage adjustments to supplement cost of living increases.",2008-07-23
52,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and based on information collected on or before August 25, 2008. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.    Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that the pace of economic activity has been slow in most Districts.  Many described business conditions as ""weak,"" ""soft,"" or ""subdued.""  Cleveland and St. Louis reported some weakening since their last reports while Boston and New York noted signs of stabilization.  Kansas City reported a slight improvement. Consumer spending was reported to be slow in most Districts, with purchasing concentrated on necessary items and retrenchment in discretionary spending. Districts reporting on auto sales described them as falling or steady at low levels. Tourism activity was mixed but received support from international visitors in several Districts, and the demand for services eased in most Districts. The transportation industry was also adversely affected by rising fuel costs. Manufacturing activity declined in most Districts but improved somewhat in Minneapolis and Kansas City. Most Districts reported that residential real estate markets remained soft. Commercial real estate activity was slow in most Districts, and some reported further slackening in demand for office and retail space. Most Districts reported easing loan demand, especially for residential mortgages and consumer loans; lending to businesses was mixed. Districts reporting on the agricultural sector noted some relief from drought conditions. Districts reporting on energy and mining activity recorded increased activity. Almost all Districts continued to report price pressures from elevated costs of energy, food, and other commodities, although some noted that there have been declines or slower increases in prices for several industrial commodities and energy products. Business contacts in a number of Districts indicated that they had increased selling prices in response to the high costs for their inputs. Wage pressures were characterized as moderate by most Districts amid a general pullback in hiring, although several Districts noted continued strong demand for workers in the energy sector. Consumer Spending and Tourism  Consumer spending was slow in most Districts. Retail sales and other consumer spending was reported as mixed or little changed in Boston, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas and weak or declining in Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco. Sales were described as below expectations in Atlanta but on or close to plan in New York. Cleveland and Kansas City noted some improvement in retail sales since the last report. Several Districts reported that consumers were concentrating on food, staples, and other necessary items while reducing spending on discretionary items. Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco reported noticeable declines in spending on apparel, electronics, and jewelry. Sales of furniture and household appliances were weak in most Districts. San Francisco described sales of this merchandise as exceptionally poor. A shift of consumer shopping patterns toward discount stores and lower-price brands and away from traditional department and specialty stores was observed in Philadelphia, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco. Sales of motor vehicles were reported to be weak or falling in all Districts, especially for larger, less fuel-efficient cars, SUVs, and trucks. Tourism activity varied across Districts. Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City reported mixed or steady conditions since the last report. Boston, New York, and Richmond reported improvement since the last report. San Francisco reported that tourism was flat to down in most major destinations in that District, significantly so in Hawaii. International visitors boosted tourism in Boston, New York, and Minneapolis. In contrast, several Districts noted that domestic vacationers appeared to be reducing miles traveled and amounts spent on trips. Boston reported that business travel has been better than expected. Nonfinancial Services Districts reporting on nonfinancial services generally indicated some slowing in activity since the last report, although New York reported stabilization after several months of decline. Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Dallas noted falling demand for freight and transportation services, and firms in those industries reported higher fuel costs negatively affecting their margins. Dallas reported that airlines were reducing capacity. Demand for information technology services was reported to be flat in Boston and down in St. Louis. St. Louis and San Francisco noted less strength in the health care sector since the last report. Business and professional services activity was weakening in St. Louis and San Francisco. Dallas reported that business was steady at accounting firms but down at legal firms. Temporary staffing activity was reported to be mixed in Boston and Richmond and stable in Dallas. Manufacturing  Manufacturing activity was weak or declining in most Districts but improved in others. New York reported some stabilization after months of decline, Kansas City reported a rebound after a weakening in June, and Minneapolis and San Francisco have made gains since the last report. A number of Districts reported that export orders were bolstering manufacturing activity, but manufacturers in several of those Districts have noted some recent slowing in growth from this source. Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas reported continuing declines in demand for housing-related products and construction materials. Boston reported declining output of aircraft and other transportation parts and equipment, but San Francisco reported a high rate of aircraft production. Output of motor vehicles and related products was falling in Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas. Boston and San Francisco reported rising demand for information technology equipment, but Dallas reported some weakening in demand for high-technology products.  Manufacturers in Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Kansas City have increased capital spending or plan to do so, but Boston reported that manufacturers in that District were reexamining capital spending plans, and Chicago reported that several firms were postponing capital projects. Real Estate and Construction Residential real estate conditions weakened or remained soft in all Districts, except Kansas City, which reported a modest increase in sales since the last report.  Demand for housing was reported to be still moving down in Boston, New York, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco. Residential real estate activity was sluggish in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas. New York reported low levels of single-family construction but a brisk pace of multi-family construction after an increase in permits in June occasioned by a change in the New York building code effective July 1. Chicago reported a faster rate of decline in residential construction since the last report as well as delays and cancellations in residential building projects. Richmond and Kansas City reported that lower and mid-price houses were selling at a better rate than more expensive houses. Atlanta and Dallas reported that inventories of unsold new houses were edging down. Commercial real estate activity moved down or remained weak in all Districts except Dallas. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Chicago reported signs of softening demand for commercial real estate, including declining leasing activity, rising vacancies, and decreasing construction. Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported that commercial real estate market conditions varied across those Districts but in general were not strong. Dallas reported an increase in office leasing but at a slower pace than in the last report. Chicago and Minneapolis noted drops in demand for retail space. Dallas and San Francisco reported that public projects were buoying construction activity. Banking and Finance District reports on bank lending generally indicated steady or slowing growth, with weakening demand for residential mortgages and consumer loans and near steady demand for commercial and industrial loans. Residential mortgage lending fell in New York and Richmond, remained slow in Chicago and Dallas, but gained slightly in Philadelphia. Consumer lending was flat to down in Cleveland, Atlanta, and St. Louis and showed little change in New York and Chicago. Commercial and industrial lending was near steady in New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland and eased in Richmond, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Demand for commercial and industrial loans rose in Chicago--mostly from small and mid-size firms--and was described as solid in Dallas. San Francisco reported that overall loan demand has fallen since the previous report. All the Districts reporting on loan standards noted tightening. New York, Cleveland, Richmond, and San Francisco reported deterioration in credit quality. Dallas indicated that credit quality was holding up, although bankers in that District expected it to decline. Districts reporting on bank funding noted that competition for deposits remained strong. In Dallas, bankers said they were pursuing nondeposit sources of liquidity. Agriculture and Natural Resources The agricultural sector continued to struggle under drought conditions in the South, although there was some relief in July and August. In the Richmond District persistent dry conditions were expected to delay crop development and reduce yields; however, the fruit and vegetable harvests have been mostly completed. Atlanta reported some benefit from recent rains, although drought conditions persisted in Georgia. Chicago reported improved crop conditions, although corn and soybean development was behind schedule. Crop development was also behind schedule in the St. Louis District where conditions improved for grain but worsened for cotton. Minneapolis reported a better than expected harvest of winter wheat and expectations that corn production would exceed last year's harvest. Dallas reported dry conditions in much of the District and noted that Hurricane Dolly destroyed cotton and sorghum in the Rio Grande valley. Kansas City reported an increase in wheat yields. Although most Districts with significant agricultural sectors reported strong demand for their products, they also noted that fuel, feed, and fertilizer costs had risen, putting pressure on profit margins. High costs were reported for livestock operations, and Kansas City and Dallas reported that herds were being culled. Energy and mining activity were strong and expanding in all of the Districts that reported on these sectors. Cleveland noted increases in oil, gas, and coal extraction since the last report. Minneapolis also reported an increase in energy activity and indicated that almost all mines in the District were operating at full capacity. Drilling activity has increased in the Kansas City District since the last report and was well above the year-ago level. Dallas reported a continued rise in the rig count, to levels above last year, with much of the increase due to drilling for natural gas. San Francisco noted an increase in petroleum production. Prices and Wages All Districts reported continuing upward price pressure from elevated input costs, although several noted recent retreats in some commodity and energy prices. Philadelphia reported rising prices for food products, industrial materials, and metals. Cleveland reported continuing increases in raw material costs, and business contacts in San Francisco said upward price pressure remained significant. Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas business contacts noted recent declines in commodity and energy prices but said price levels remained high. In Philadelphia, retailers reported rising wholesale costs. Retail price inflation edged up in Richmond. New York and Chicago reported little change in retail prices. Business contacts in Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Dallas indicated that high prices for their inputs were leading them to step up the pass-through of higher costs to their selling prices. Similar reports of the pass-through of costs to prices came from manufacturers in the Boston and New York Districts as well as from shippers in the Cleveland District.  Chicago and San Francisco reported that the pass-through of costs to prices was more limited.   Labor market conditions were unchanged or somewhat softer in most Districts compared with the last report. Wage increases were typically characterized as moderate. Boston reported mostly modest wage increases except for greater hikes in salaries at information technology companies. Philadelphia reported moderate wage gains and limited hiring. Cleveland noted wage pressures in the energy sector but not in manufacturing or construction. Atlanta received scattered reports of wage increases, mainly in the professional services and the energy sectors, and more generally in coastal areas undergoing rebuilding after storm damage. Chicago indicated that labor markets have weakened and there was little wage pressure other than for a few skilled trades. Kansas City reported steady wage pressure but noted that there were shortages of qualified workers in the energy sector. Dallas also noted shortages of workers in the energy sector but indicated that wage pressure was mild overall. San Francisco reported some easing in upward wage pressure as firms in that District have been reducing staff counts, although demand remained strong for skilled workers in the resource extraction and information technology industries.",2008-09-03
53,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and based on information collected on or before October 6, 2008. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.   Reports indicated that economic activity weakened in September across all twelve Federal Reserve Districts.  Several Districts also noted that their contacts had become more pessimistic about the economic outlook. Consumer spending decreased in most Districts, with declines reported in retailing, auto sales and tourism.  Nearly all Districts commenting on nonfinancial service industries noted reduced activity.  Manufacturing slowed in most Districts.  Residential real estate markets remained weak, and commercial real estate activity slowed in many Districts.  Credit conditions were characterized as being tight across the twelve Districts, with several reporting reduced credit availability for both financial and nonfinancial institutions.  District reports on agriculture and natural resources were mostly positive, although adverse weather associated with hurricanes Ike and Gustav negatively affected the South and the Midwest. Inflationary pressures moderated a bit in September.  While several Districts noted continuing pass-through of earlier price increases for metals, food and energy, most indicated that cost pressures had eased.  Labor market conditions weakened in most Districts, and wage pressures remained limited.  Several Districts reported lower capital spending or reductions in capital spending plans due to the high level of uncertainty about the economic outlook or concerns over the availability of credit. Consumer Spending and Tourism  Consumer spending was softer in nearly all Districts.  Retail sales were reported to have weakened or declined in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City; Dallas and San Francisco cited weak or sluggish sales; and Boston and New York indicated that sales were mixed and moderately below plan sales, respectively.  Several Districts noted a reduction in discretionary spending by consumers and lower sales on big-ticket items.  Several also reported increased activity at discount stores as consumers became more price conscious and shifted purchases toward less-expensive brands.  Retailers cited these recent sales trends and concerns about credit availability as reasons for a weaker economic outlook, including a slow holiday season.  Most Districts reporting on light vehicle sales saw declines, with several Districts pointing to reduced credit availability as a limiting factor for automobile sales. However, Kansas City, St. Louis, and Chicago noted that dealers offering incentive and discount programs had seen some positive effect on sales.  Tourism was mixed or weaker for tourist destinations on the East and West coasts, while both Minneapolis and Atlanta indicated that increases in international travelers were helping to offset lower domestic travel.  Business Spending Hiring and capital spending varied across Districts.  Labor market conditions weakened in most Districts.  Boston, Chicago and Richmond cited reductions in hiring or hiring plans.  Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, San Francisco and Dallas all noted some weakening in employment.  However, the demand for skilled labor remained strong in several Districts, and Kansas City noted market tightness for minimum-wage jobs in leisure and hospitality.  Several Districts reported that capital spending decisions were being influenced by economic uncertainty.  New York, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco noted weaker capital spending.  Boston reported capital spending was mixed as firms were cautious about spending resources.  Cleveland reported capital spending remained on plan but intentions to increase outlays have declined.  Philadelphia indicated concerns over restrictions in access to credit were limiting future capital expenditures for some manufacturers.  In contrast, Kansas City and Chicago reported that capital spending for producers of heavy machinery continued to be strong. Nonfinancial Services  Nonfinancial service industries experienced weaker activity in most Districts.  Several Districts reported that activity in real-estate and related industries such as legal and title services was weak.  New York cited widespread deterioration in business conditions. Boston reported consulting firms were experiencing reduced demand for their services from a range of clients.  Cleveland, St. Louis, and Dallas noted slower activity in the transportation industry; however, Dallas' slowdown was due mostly to temporary disruptions caused by hurricane Ike.  Trucking contacts in Atlanta indicated declines in retail, automotive, and construction-related shipments, but increases in energy and farm products.  Minneapolis reported continued strength in professional business services, while demand for professional business services was down in San Francisco and Philadelphia.  Demand for healthcare-related services was strong in Boston, Richmond, and Chicago, but weaker in St. Louis and San Francisco.  Staffing firms reported lower demand for their services in Richmond, Philadelphia, and Chicago, but noted steady demand in Dallas.    Manufacturing  Manufacturing activity moved lower in most Districts, and contacts expressed heightened concern about the economic outlook.  Several Districts noted that credit conditions were contributing to a high level of uncertainty on the part of contacts.  Declines in manufacturing activity of varying degrees were reported in Boston, New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, San Francisco, and Dallas.  Atlanta reported that production remained at a low level, while Minneapolis described conditions as mixed and Philadelphia noted a slight increase in activity.  Metals-related industries, including the domestic steel industry, reported slower activity, although overall levels of production were still high in several Districts.  Producers of housing-related items, building materials and construction equipment continued to experience low levels of demand across the twelve Districts.  Activity in the automotive industry also continued to decline.  Kansas City, Richmond, Philadelphia and Chicago reported continued strength in exports.  However, Atlanta indicated a decline in export orders, reversing a trend of the past several months. Energy-related manufacturers and heavy equipment manufacturers with ties to energy or agriculture continued to do well in most Districts. Dallas and Atlanta reported that hurricanes Ike and Gustav disrupted oil production and refining, restricting the supply of petroleum and related products and leading to gasoline shortages in the Southeast and along the East coast.   Real Estate and Construction  Residential real estate and construction activity weakened or remained low in all Districts.  Housing activity was reported to have moved lower in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco.  While still slow, residential markets showed some signs of stabilizing in Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City.  Several Districts noted continuing downward price pressures and an increasing supply of homes for sale due to rising foreclosures.  However, the inventory of unsold homes was reported to have declined in areas of the Boston and Atlanta Districts as well as in Philadelphia and Cleveland.  Tighter credit conditions were cited as a limiting factor for demand in several Districts.  Most Districts reported commercial real estate and construction activity had slowed, with New York, San Francisco and Dallas noting the sharpest declines.  In contrast, Cleveland and St. Louis indicated steady activity.  Increases in vacancy rates or sublease space were noted in Chicago, Boston, New York, Atlanta, and San Francisco.  Several Districts reported project delays and cancellations due to tighter credit conditions and increased economic uncertainty. Banking and Finance  Credit conditions tightened in all the Districts that reported on them.  Bank lending was described as either stable or lower for both consumers and businesses.  Cleveland, Kansas City, and San Francisco noted that loan quality had deteriorated.  Credit standards were tightened, particularly for commercial and residential real estate loans, in several Districts.  Several also indicated that lenders in their District had become more highly cautious and more conservative.  Richmond noted increased scrutiny of loan applications by banks and higher collateral requirements on commercial lending, and Cleveland and New York cited increases in loan pricing.  Some Districts also mentioned customers taking steps to ensure that existing deposits are covered by insurance and noted deposit withdrawals after reports of bank closings during September.  Liquidity problems in inter-bank markets along with a higher cost of funds were reported in several Districts.  As a result, Chicago reported that banks were increasingly utilizing alternative sources of funds like the discount window and the brokered CD market; and Kansas City noted that banks had become more cautious in their liquidity management.  Several Districts cited reports from businesses of difficulties in obtaining credit.  Agriculture and Natural Resources  Agricultural conditions remained favorable in most of the Districts reporting on them. Corn and soybean harvests were somewhat behind schedule in Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City.  Heavier precipitation slowed the harvests in some Districts, but aided agriculture in Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas.  Drought continued to be a problem in parts of the Atlanta District, and hurricanes damaged agriculture in parts of the Dallas District.  Yield projections slipped since the summer, but were still expected to be near historical averages.  Livestock producers faced tighter margins due to high feed costs and problems with feed availability in some Districts.  Most agricultural product prices fell in September.  Exports continued to boost agricultural demand, while domestic demand lagged for some commodities.  Conditions for the energy and mining sectors were positive, except for temporary damage to infrastructure from the recent hurricanes.  Disruptions to offshore oil drilling in Dallas were not as extensive as they were after other recent major hurricanes.  Drilling in the U.S. increased, especially for natural gas.  Coal prices were stable, while oil and natural gas prices declined.  Even so, energy operations looked to expand in Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco.  In addition, Minneapolis reported new mining activity.  Prices and Wages  Most Districts reported that cost pressures on prices had eased, although a number of Districts noted that the costs of energy, raw materials, food, and transportation remain elevated and margins were tight.  Manufacturers in New York said that they plan selling price increases; but, with activity weakening, fewer other businesses anticipate price increases.  Dallas noted that businesses facing softer demand plan to pass cost reductions on to customers, and Cleveland cited a decline in fuel surcharges as gasoline prices fell.  However, respondents in Chicago and Dallas also reported that they continued efforts to pass-through earlier cost increases.  Philadelphia, Dallas, and San Francisco noted increased discounting by retailers; Richmond reported that retail prices were rising less quickly; and Kansas City reported only a slight rise in retail prices.  On the other hand, retailers in Chicago and Kansas City expect to raise prices further in coming months, and some in San Francisco also anticipate that the cost increases in train will lead to higher retail prices later this year and in 2009.  Wage pressures across the twelve Districts remained limited outside of skilled labor positions that continue to experience high demand, such as the energy industry in Cleveland, Dallas, and Kansas City.",2008-10-15
54,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and based on information collected before November 24, 2008. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.   Overall economic activity weakened across all Federal Reserve Districts since the last report. Districts generally reported decreases in retail sales, and vehicle sales were down significantly in most Districts. Tourism spending was subdued in a number of Districts. Reports on the service sector were generally negative. Manufacturing activity declined in most Districts, and new orders were soft. Nearly all Districts reported weak housing markets characterized by reduced selling prices and low, but stable, sales activity. Commercial real estate markets declined in most Districts. Lending contracted, with many Districts reporting reductions in residential, commercial and industrial lending and tightening lending standards. Agricultural conditions were mixed with a relatively good harvest but concerns about profitability. Mining and energy production and exploration started to soften due to lower output prices. District reports generally described labor market conditions as weakening. Wage pressures were largely subdued. District reports characterized price pressures as easing in light of some decreases in retail prices and declines in input prices, particularly energy, fuel, and many raw materials and food products. Consumer Spending and Tourism Consumer spending weakened during the reporting period. Retail sales were described as weak or down in the New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco Districts. In Kansas City, consumer spending slowed sharply. Recent retail sales were steady compared with early fall but were lower than a year ago in Philadelphia and were mixed in Boston. Some Districts reported decreased purchases of big-ticket items, including furniture, appliances, electronics and luxury items. Discount stores reported stronger sales volumes than department stores. Inventory levels were relatively stable, as many stores anticipated the recent slowdown in sales. District reports indicated that retailers were preparing for a relatively slow holiday sales season. New York noted that this season is likely to feature more price discounting than last year. Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland and Dallas reported that some retailers have cut back capital expenditure plans for 2009. District reports indicated that vehicle sales deteriorated since the last report. Sales of more expensive and less fuel efficient vehicles were particularly slow. However, Kansas City noted an increase in demand for used cars. Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City and San Francisco reported that a number of car buyers had difficulty obtaining financing. Tourism activity was relatively slow. Fall tourism was down in New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City and San Francisco, while tourism conditions were mixed in Richmond. Kansas City and San Francisco reported slower restaurant business. Atlanta noted that business travel was down, while San Francisco reported a rising incidence of canceled corporate meetings in Southern California. In contrast, reservations at a ski resort in the Richmond District were somewhat stronger for the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, and some tourism businesses in the Minneapolis District were cautiously optimistic for the winter season in part due to lower gasoline prices.  Services Activity in the services sector generally contracted in most Districts since the last report. New York, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco reported deteriorating conditions. Most of these Districts were seeing weakness across a wide range of services, including advertising, architecture, business support, information technology, legal services and temporary help firms. Boston reported mixed conditions for information technology services, ranging from declines of 10 percent to gains of 25 percent.  Minneapolis and Dallas reported growing demand for bankruptcy services, and Richmond noted that telecommunications and CPA firms were facing strong demand.  Manufacturing Manufacturing activity declined noticeably since the last report. All 12 Districts reported weaker manufacturing conditions, to varying extents. Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond and Kansas City reported reductions in orders. Almost all Districts noted reductions in exports. Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago and Atlanta reported lower shipping volumes. Dallas reported weakness in most forms of transportation. Nearly every District reported decreased demand for construction materials; Cleveland and Chicago noted, in particular, decreased steel production. Several Districts reported multiple plant shut-downs, and expectations for capital expenditure were down. A few sectors saw increased activity. Boston, Chicago, St. Louis and San Francisco noted stronger demand for aerospace manufacturers. St. Louis, Dallas and San Francisco reported increases in food processing. Real Estate and Construction Residential real estate continued at a slow pace nationwide. Sales were down in most Districts, but mixed activity was noted in the Boston, Atlanta and Minneapolis Districts. Boston, New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City and Dallas noted decreases in housing prices. Inventories of unsold homes remained high in the New York, Atlanta, Kansas City and San Francisco Districts, but declined in Chicago and Minneapolis. Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago and Kansas City reported relatively stronger demand for lower- and middle-priced ""starter homes."" Commercial real estate markets weakened broadly. Vacancy rates rose in Boston, New York, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City and San Francisco, but were mixed across markets in the St. Louis District. Leasing activity was down in almost all Districts. Rents fell in the Boston, New York and Kansas City Districts. Despite reductions in construction materials costs, commercial building activity declined in many Districts with tighter credit conditions as a factor. Banking and Finance Business and consumer lending activity continued to slow in most Districts. New York reported weakening loan demand in all categories, while Kansas City and San Francisco also witnessed substantial lending declines. Lending activity in other Districts was mixed among loan categories. In contrast, Philadelphia indicated that its banks saw loan volume rise in November, and some regional banks reported picking up new business borrowers. Cleveland reported that business loan volume has been steady to higher, and some bankers reported actively marketing their loan business. Credit standards rose across the nation, with several Districts noting increases in loan delinquencies and defaults, especially in the real estate sector. Credit conditions remained tight. Chicago reported that FDIC actions and Federal Reserve lending had improved liquidity and slowed deposit outflows. Dallas indicated that government capital investments have led larger institutions to feel less constrained in their lending, while some smaller banks reported that scrutiny from regulators was making new deals more difficult to forge.   Agriculture and Natural Resources Districts reported mixed results in agriculture. Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City and Dallas expected decent harvests. However, Richmond, Chicago and Minneapolis reported delays in harvests due to wet weather. Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco reported decreases in several crop and/or cattle prices. Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco noted that cattle producers' profits were squeezed. Tightening credit conditions for agricultural producers were noted in the Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco Districts. The bankruptcy of a large ethanol producer created uncertainty for crop producers near its Midwest plants.   Activity in the energy and mining sectors decreased since the last report. Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco reported softening in oil and gas activity due to lower prices and, in some cases, weather disruptions. Meanwhile, mining activity decreased in the Minneapolis District.  Labor Markets Signs of labor market slowing were evident in several District reports. Boston, Richmond, Chicago and Dallas reported that demand for temporary staff decreased. Boston and Cleveland noted that seasonal hiring has been scaled back at retail stores. Several businesses in the Atlanta District reported that layoffs accelerated and hours declined. Chicago noted that further weakness in the demand for labor was expected in a number of sectors. Dallas reported that job cuts were particularly pronounced in the manufacturing sector. San Francisco reported job cuts and hiring freezes across a wide range of industries. However, demand for skilled labor remained strong in Chicago, contacts in Boston reported difficulty filling open positions in some professions and Minneapolis cited difficulty finding skilled workers in some areas. Wage pressures were largely subdued. Richmond reported that wages for temporary employment remained unchanged, while wages in the retail sector declined. Aside from health care and other high-skill technical positions, most contacts in Atlanta suggested that wage pressures continued to diminish. Business operators in the Minneapolis District indicated that they expect only modest wage increases in their communities during 2009. Chicago, Kansas City and Dallas reported minimal wage pressures. In San Francisco, the region's few open positions have been attracting large numbers of applicants, thereby alleviating upward wage pressures. Prices District reports characterized price pressures as easing in light of some decreases in retail prices and declines in input prices, particularly for energy, fuel, and many raw materials and food products. In the New York District, firms across a wide range of industries reported that their selling prices have leveled off, while prices paid have decelerated. Philadelphia noted that reports on input costs and output prices showed a general decline. Cleveland reported that transportation surcharges were removed for some contacts. In Atlanta, most District contacts reported that they did not plan to raise output prices due to lower input costs and weaker demand. A manufacturer in Minneapolis noted success in passing along input cost increases to customers, but will likely lower prices going forward. Manufacturers in Kansas City reported a sharp deceleration in raw materials prices. Many contacts in Dallas reported that they resisted price-cutting pressures from their customers, but that they expected to lower prices over the next several months. San Francisco noted declines in the prices of transportation services. A number of District reports mentioned that retailers were widely discounting prices in anticipation of a slow holiday sales season.",2008-12-03
55,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and based on information collected on or before January 5, 2009.  This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.   Overall economic activity continued to weaken across almost all of the Federal Reserve Districts since the previous reporting period.  Most Districts noted reduced or low activity across a wide range of industries, although a few Districts noted some exceptions in some sectors. District reports indicate that retail sales were generally weak, particularly during the holiday season.  A majority of Districts noted deep discounting during the holiday sales season.  Vehicle sales were also weak or down overall in the Districts reporting on them.  Manufacturing activity decreased in most Districts.  Declines were noted in a wide range of manufacturing industries, with a few exceptions.  Services sector activity generally declined across the Districts, with exceptions in some sectors of the Boston, Richmond, and Chicago Districts.  Additionally, several Districts noted weaker conditions in transportation services and slow or decreased demand in tourism activity.  Conditions in residential real estate markets continued to worsen in most Districts.  Reduced home sales, lower prices, or decreases in construction activity were noted in many Districts.  Commercial real estate markets deteriorated in most Districts, with weakening construction noted in several Districts.  Overall lending activity declined in several Districts, with tight or tightening lending conditions reported in most Districts.  Credit quality remained a concern in several Districts.  Agricultural conditions were mixed in response to varying weather conditions across the Districts.  Mining and energy production activity generally declined since the previous report. Most Districts reported a general weakening of labor market conditions.  Lower energy prices were noted in many of the Districts, and, except for the Richmond District, which mentioned higher prices for raw materials, most reporting Districts noted declining input prices.  Wage pressures remained largely contained, and some Districts reported pay freezes or reductions in compensation.  Consumer Spending Reports of retail sales during the holiday season were generally negative in most Districts.  Retail sales during the holiday season were weak or mostly down in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts.  However, some contacts in the Boston and New York Districts noted that sales picked up after the holidays.  Retail sales in the Cleveland District were flat to down in November (on a month-over-month basis).  Most retailers in the Richmond District had disappointing sales during the holiday season.  Discount stores fared relatively better in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts, although discount stores in the Dallas District reported weak holiday sales.  Deep discounting during the holiday season was reported in the New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts.  Several Districts reported that luxury and big-ticket items (e.g., jewelry, appliances, and electronics) were weak sellers.  Richmond reported that sales of gift cards were weaker than the previous year.  In the New York District, cold-weather apparel was a relatively strong seller.  Many retailers in the Philadelphia, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts expected continued weakness or sluggish sales.  However, expectations were mixed in the Cleveland District, and retailers in the Boston District were watchful. Each of the ten Districts that reported on vehicle sales indicated that sales during the season were weak or down overall (Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco).  Sales of domestic brands were especially weak in the Richmond and Dallas Districts.  Chicago reported increased demand for light trucks and San Francisco reported a slight increase in sales of larger used vehicles.  Both of these changes were reported to be in response to falling gas prices.  In addition, Dallas reported an increase in sales of used vehicles.  Several Districts reported a negative outlook among car dealers. Manufacturing and Other Business Activity Manufacturing activity continued to fall in most Districts since the previous report, with declines reported across a wide range of industries.  Cleveland noted a slump in steel shipping and Chicago noted that domestic steel production slowed.  Dallas and Philadelphia indicated that industries related to construction experienced large drops in orders, and Richmond noted that import activity for construction and household products remains notably low.  San Francisco reported that activity for producers of wood products remains depressed.  Kansas City, St. Louis, Cleveland, and Dallas noted decreases in auto and auto-related manufacturing activity.  Cleveland, Dallas, and San Francisco reported that capacity utilization was below normal levels or declined.  Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Chicago, and Kansas City mentioned reductions in capital spending or plans to reduce capital spending in 2009.  In contrast, firms in defense and medical-device production in the Minneapolis District reported increased activity, and San Francisco noted that aerospace manufacturing continued at a high level.  Food manufacturing and processing remained active in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts and solid in the San Francisco District. Activity in the services sector declined throughout most Districts.  Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas reported slowed or declining activity for transportation services, often related to the shipping of construction and manufactured goods.  San Francisco, St. Louis, New York, Chicago, Kansas City, and Minneapolis reported declines in travel or tourism-related services.  Richmond and Atlanta noted that tourism activity was mixed, and Boston indicated that a majority of consulting and advertising firms reported stable to strong demand.  Service activity at auto dealers continued to be robust in the Chicago District, and it increased in the Dallas District. Real Estate and Construction Residential real estate activity continued to weaken in nearly all Districts.  Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas reported that home sales were weak or had declined.  San Francisco reported that despite some pickup in recent months, home sales continued to be quite slow in most parts of the District.  In the New York District, the market for new homes continued to weaken in New Jersey, and the higher-priced housing markets nearest to New York City were characterized as especially weak.  While the Minneapolis District reported that late December saw an up-tick in residential sale activity in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, it was reportedly driven by foreclosures and short sales.  Increased home sale cancellations were common in a few Districts.  Contacts in the Dallas District reported that home sale cancellations remained prevalent, in some cases outpacing sales.  Elevated cancellation rates and weak showroom traffic in the Chicago District led developers to remain cautious about expanding inventory levels, and some building contractors in the Cleveland District reported increased inventories because of take-backs from home sales that fell through.  Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported that home prices continued to soften or fall.  Median selling prices declined in and around New York City and were reported to have edged down in the Dallas District.  Richmond, however, reported that home prices remained steady. Reporting Districts generally saw a decrease in homebuilding.  Atlanta reported that homebuilders continued to pull back on home construction.  The Philadelphia and Chicago Districts noted that residential building continued its decline.  Residential construction was down in the St. Louis District, remained weak in Cleveland, and was quiet in Minneapolis. Commercial real estate markets deteriorated in most Districts.  Contacts in the Boston District described the commercial real estate market as grim and depressing, and market conditions continued to deteriorate in Richmond.  In the Minneapolis District, a contact noted that the market remained in a downturn that has now lasted more than a year.  Commercial real estate transactions in the Dallas District have reportedly ground to a halt.  Leasing activity was minimal in the Boston District, continued to fall in the Philadelphia District, and was assessed as ranging from slowing to frozen in the Richmond District.  Contacts in the Chicago District reported increases in sublease space.  Office and industrial leasing is expected to remain steady through the first half of 2009 in the St. Louis District, but San Francisco reported that conditions in their commercial office market remained exceptionally weak.  The New York District reported that Manhattan's office vacancy rate climbed to its highest level in two years.  Contacts in the Chicago District noted elevated vacancy rates, and contacts in the Kansas City District expected higher vacancy rates going forward.  Contacts in the Atlanta District also anticipate that more commercial space will become available. Reports about commercial construction activity also were downbeat.  In the Philadelphia District, commercial construction activity continued to fall.  Cleveland reported that construction backlogs have declined for some contractors.  Commercial contractors in the Atlanta and Chicago Districts reported declines in building activity and noted that more projects were cancelled or postponed.  In St. Louis, contacts in commercial and industrial construction predicted a challenging environment in early 2009.  San Francisco reported that commercial construction activity was very limited.  Construction-related manufacturing contacts in the Dallas District reported that demand from commercial construction is shrinking rapidly. Banking and Finance Most Districts that reported on lending activity indicated that it continued to decline or remained weak, and many Districts reported that credit conditions remained tight or tightened further.  Overall lending activity was reported to have slowed or declined in New York, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas; it remained soft or weak in the Chicago and San Francisco Districts.  Philadelphia reported a slow rise in outstanding loan volume with gains in real estate loans and consumer credit, but no business-loan growth.  Demand for commercial loans was stable to decreasing in the Cleveland and Richmond Districts.  Kansas City reported that demand fell for commercial and industrial loans, while San Francisco indicated that commercial and industrial loan volumes were at very low levels.  In contrast, St. Louis reported a slight increase in commercial and industrial loans.  New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco noted an increase in residential mortgage refinancing activity.  Demand for consumer loans declined in the Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts.  St. Louis reported an increase in loans to individuals. Regarding credit conditions, Boston reported that credit availability continues to be a major barrier to commercial real estate activity, and San Francisco noted that the availability of credit remains quite constrained.  The New York and Atlanta Districts indicated a general tightening of credit standards, while Kansas City noted tighter standards for commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans.  Credit standards were described as unchanged to tightening further by Cleveland and Richmond, while Dallas noted that depository institutions maintained tight credit standards.  Chicago reported that credit conditions remained tight.  Credit quality declined or remained a concern in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts.  Default rates on commercial loans are expected to rise in the Boston District.  Richmond indicated mixed reports on credit quality. Agriculture Weather conditions since the previous report had mixed effects on agricultural activity.  Recent rain eased drought conditions in most of the Atlanta District, while parts of the Dallas District were still severely dry.  Weather conditions allowed for fieldwork in the Atlanta and Minneapolis Districts but delayed fieldwork in the Richmond and Chicago Districts.  The winter wheat crop in the Kansas City District was in good condition, while winter wheat development in the Richmond District was hindered by cooler temperatures and rain in recent weeks.  The livestock sector in the Kansas City District and the poultry sector in the Atlanta District reported slowed activity, while production of red meat and some types of poultry decreased in the St. Louis District.  The Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported that farm input costs (e.g., fuel and fertilizer) have moderated or declined recently.  Dallas reported that commodity prices have dropped, but Chicago and Kansas City reported that corn and soybean prices have rebounded slightly. Natural Resource Industries Activity in the energy sector declined in several Districts since the previous report, with a number of Districts linking the decrease to lower energy prices.  In the Atlanta and Minneapolis Districts, oil and gas exploration declined.  Kansas City reported a dramatic slowing in energy activity, and Dallas reported a decrease in drilling activity and a decline in the number of active oil rigs since the previous survey.  In contrast, energy production did not change in the Cleveland District, and coal production in the St. Louis District was higher in December 2008 than in December 2007. Looking ahead, contacts in the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts expect drilling activity to decline for the first few months of 2009.    Regarding capital spending, contacts in the Atlanta District indicate that oil and gas exploration firms re-evaluated expansion plans in response to lower oil prices and difficulty obtaining credit.  Energy producers in the Kansas City District are cutting capital budgets, but producers in the Cleveland District expect little change to their capital spending in early 2009.  Finally, iron ore production in the Minneapolis District decreased since the previous report. Labor Markets Most Districts reported a general weakening of labor market conditions.  Most Districts reported that layoffs continued, and Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, and Dallas noted hiring freezes for select firms.  Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas reported reduced hours to control costs.  Job losses in the manufacturing sector were reported by contacts in the Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts.  Dallas noted that layoffs were becoming widespread in the energy industry, and New York noted that a substantial number of job reductions in the financial sector have yet to show up in payroll statistics.  Richmond reported weaker demand for temporary workers.  In contrast, contacts in Chicago indicated that demand for skilled workers remained strong.  Richmond noted that demand was strongest for workers providing professional and support services, workers with high-level technical skills, and workers proficient in computer software.  Chicago noted employment growth in the education, government, and healthcare fields.  St. Louis also noted job growth in some small business support services firms.  Cleveland reported continued hiring in defense-related and healthcare industries. Prices Consumers saw sizable holiday price cuts in retail stores in a majority of the Districts.  Retail contacts in the New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported heavy holiday discounting.  Retailers and restaurant contacts in the Kansas City District lowered prices and anticipated further declines in the months ahead.  Lower energy prices were noted throughout many of the Districts.  Most contacts in the Atlanta District reported reduced input price pressures, and about half of the contacts in manufacturing and related services in the Boston District reported falling input prices.  Boston reported large price decreases for energy, oil-based materials, paper, and cotton in particular.  In the Kansas City District, raw materials prices fell sharply, and manufacturers in general reported a corresponding decline in finished product prices.  Manufacturers in the Philadelphia District also reported decreases in commodity prices and some reported a reduction in the prices of their own products as well.  Contacts in the Cleveland District observed that the downward trend in raw materials prices has started to level off and that pricing of manufactured products remained relatively stable.  On the other hand, the Richmond District noted that raw materials prices rose at a slightly quicker pace since last reported.  Contacts in the San Francisco District reported that they expect upward price pressures to remain very limited during early 2009. Wages Wage pressures remained largely contained in most Districts.  The Cleveland, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported little to no wage pressures.  Richmond noted that wage gains in the retail sector held up, but average wage increases slowed for service firms.  Wage increases were modest in the Minneapolis District, and wage pressures diminished in the Kansas City District.  A few Districts experienced slowing wage gains in sectors that had previously seen rapid wage advances, notably the energy sector in the Cleveland District and the technology sector in the San Francisco District.  According to reports from the New York District, year-end bonuses at financial firms are seen falling 20 to 30 percent from a year ago at some of the smaller firms but more substantially at the larger establishments.  The Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts also noted that some contacts are enacting or considering pay freezes or reductions in compensation.",2009-01-14
56,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco based on information collected on or before February 23, 2009.  This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.   Reports  from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that national economic  conditions deteriorated further during the reporting period of January through  late February.  Ten of the twelve reports  indicated weaker conditions or declines in economic activity; the exceptions  were Philadelphia  and Chicago,  which reported that their regional economies ""remained weak.""  The deterioration was broad based, with only  a few sectors such as basic food production and pharmaceuticals appearing to be  exceptions.  Looking ahead, contacts from  various Districts rate the prospects for near-term improvement in economic  conditions as poor, with a significant pickup not expected before late 2009 or  early 2010.  Consumer spending remained sluggish on  net, although many Districts noted some improvement in January and February  compared with a dismal holiday spending season.   Travel and tourist activity fell noticeably in key destinations, as did  activity for a wide range of nonfinancial services, with substantial job cuts  noted in many instances.  Reports on  manufacturing activity suggested steep declines in activity in some sectors and  pronounced declines overall.  Conditions  weakened somewhat for agricultural producers and substantially for extractors  of natural resources, with reduced global demand cited as an underlying  determinant in both cases.  Markets for  residential real estate remained largely stagnant, with only minimal and  scattered signs of stabilization emerging in some areas, while demand for  commercial real estate weakened significantly.  Reports from banks and other financial  institutions indicated further drops in business loan demand, a slight deterioration  in credit quality for businesses and households, and continued tight credit  availability.   Upward price pressures continued to  ease across a broad spectrum of final goods and services.  This was largely associated with lower prices  for energy and assorted raw materials compared with earlier periods, but also with  weak final demand more generally, which spurred price discounting for items  other than energy and food.  With rising layoffs  and hiring freezes, unemployment has risen in all areas, reducing or  eliminating upward wage pressures.  A  number of reports pointed to outright reductions in hourly compensation costs,  through wage reductions and reduction or elimination of some employment  benefits.  Consumer Spending and Tourism Consumer spending remained very weak  on balance, albeit with slight firming noted by many Districts, particularly compared  with holiday-season sales that were very disappointing.  About half of the Districts reported that  consumer demand was softer than during recent reporting periods or fell  significantly below levels twelve months earlier.  However, compared with the preceding  reporting period that included the holiday season, retail spending was  described as ""mixed"" in the Boston and Richmond Districts, ""nearly steady"" in  Philadelphia, and slightly improved in Cleveland and Dallas, while New York  reported a reduced rate of decline compared with the ""steep"" pace in December.  But San    Francisco characterized retail sales as ""anemic"" and  pointed to double-digit sales declines relative to twelve months earlier for  many retail outlets.  As reported by Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco, discount  chains fared much better than traditional department stores and specialized  retailers, recording sales gains in many cases as consumers continued to switch  away from discretionary spending and luxury items and toward basic necessities.    The weakness in discretionary spending was also reflected in  relative sales by product type.  Sales of  luxury goods such as jewelry, electronic equipment, and other big ticket items  were reported to be especially slow in the Philadelphia, Richmond, and Chicago Districts.  Demand for furniture, appliances, and other  durable household items remained quite depressed, according to Kansas City and San Francisco.  Sales of new automobiles and light trucks  remained exceptionally sluggish, with Philadelphia,  Richmond, and Kansas City reporting  further declines from an already slow pace of sales.  Used vehicles fared better in general, with Kansas City and San Francisco noting that  they were selling well and Cleveland  and Chicago  reporting improvement over the previous period.   Reports of gains in retail spending were largely limited to grocery  stores and pharmacies, although reports from Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Richmond indicated some pickup in sales of  apparel, which the latter District attributed in part to severe winter weather.  Travel and tourist activity  continued to fall in most areas, as households reduced their vacation travel  and corporate travel spending was scaled back.   Tourist visits and spending were reported to be slower than in the  previous reporting period or down from twelve months earlier for major tourist  destinations in the Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, New York, and San Francisco  Districts, with the declines in the latter two characterized as ""substantial""  and ""sharp,"" respectively.  Airline  traffic fell in the Kansas City,  Dallas, and San  Francisco Districts.  Business at restaurants  dropped substantially in some areas, notably in the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts, with  extensive layoffs and restaurant closures reported in the latter. Nonfinancial Services Reports on nonfinancial services  indicated significant drops in activity accompanied by widespread job cuts.  Providers of health-care services reported  falling patient volumes, which were attributed in part to a drop in elective  procedures in the Richmond,  Minneapolis, and  San Francisco Districts.  Demand  continued to fall for professional services such as business consulting and  accounting services, legal services, and other professional services in various  Districts.  However, Dallas noted a modest increase, albeit less-than-expected,  in demand for legal services due to increased bankruptcy proceedings.  Providers of information technology (IT)  services in the Boston District saw a drop in activity on average, although  some firms have sustained strong revenue growth; activity among providers of IT  services was reported as stable to up in Kansas City, and Minneapolis reported  that some IT services firms have seen solid demand from companies that are  intent on using the technology to reduce costs.   Demand for staffing services weakened  considerably.  Boston reported that outcomes for providers  of temporary staffing services were ""dismal,"" with revenue declines in the  range of 20 to 50 percent compared with twelve months earlier.  Chicago and Dallas also reported sizable  declines in activity by staffing firms, and New York noted that activity by a major  employment agency has ""virtually ground to a halt.""  Demand for shipping and transportation  services fell further.  New York, Cleveland, Richmond, and Atlanta reported reduced activity and layoffs  among trucking and rail companies, with the decline in activity described as  considerable in some cases.  Richmond  also reported that shipping activity through ports in that District slowed further,  as imports and exports both continued on a downward trend. Manufacturing Manufacturing activity fell on net  in all Districts, with very sharp declines recorded for some sectors and only partial  offsets provided by the few bright spots.   Cleveland  reported a drop in overall factory output of about 25 percent compared with twelve  months earlier.  For most Districts, the  drop in activity was especially pronounced for makers of capital goods and construction-related  equipment and materials, such as primary metals, wood products, and electrical  equipment, along with consumer durables such as autos and furniture.  Manufacturers of computers, semiconductors,  and other IT products saw further declines in production and orders in the Dallas and San Francisco  Districts.  Slower export sales were cited  as a source of weakness for various manufacturing sectors by the Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts.   Manufacturing of biotechnology products and pharmaceuticals was one  bright spot, with Boston  reporting sales gains at a double-digit pace for biopharmaceutical firms, Richmond noting continued  hiring of temporary staff among life sciences and pharmaceutical companies, and  Chicago  reporting continued strong demand for pharmaceuticals.  Aircraft manufacturers in the St. Louis  District are planning to expand existing production facilities; activity in  this sector was largely stable in the Cleveland  and San Francisco Districts, but contacts expect some slowing in the future as  airlines reduce capacity due to a slowdown in air travel.  Food processers and manufacturers of selected  chemicals also saw further increases in demand during the reporting period, according  to Philadelphia  and San Francisco.   As a result of declining production,  capacity utilization fell in most manufacturing sectors, with rates as low as 25  to 50 percent reported for some metal fabricators.  Several Districts reported that capital  spending plans were curtailed further during the reporting period, notably for  companies in the retail sector and within manufacturing, which suggests the  possibility of further reductions in orders for capital goods going forward.  Real Estate and Construction Residential real estate markets remained  in the doldrums in most areas, with only scattered, very tentative signs of  stabilization reported.  The pace of  sales remained very low in most areas and declined further in some; most  Districts reported small declines, but New York cited a sales drop of 60 to 65  percent in Manhattan compared with twelve months earlier.  By contrast, Cleveland, Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco each reported a rising or  better-than-expected sales pace for existing or new homes in some areas,  attributed largely to falling prices and improved financing terms for some  types of home mortgages.  House prices  continued to decline, reportedly at double-digit paces in some areas, with  little or no signs of a deceleration evident.   Builders in various Districts generally remain pessimistic regarding  recovery prospects this year, and consequently the pace of new home  construction declined further in most areas.    Demand for commercial, industrial,  and retail space fell further during the reporting period, with some evidence  of more rapid deterioration than in preceding periods.  Vacancy rates rose and lease rates declined on  a widespread basis; New York noted that commercial real estate markets  ""weakened noticeably,"" while Atlanta described reports on commercial real  estate that were ""decidedly more negative"" than in previous periods.  Construction activity has declined  commensurately, and assorted reports suggest that market participants expect  this weakness to continue at least through the end of 2009.  Cleveland  noted that public works projects have shown stability of late, although they  declined in the San Francisco District as a result of the budgetary struggles  of some state and local governments there.  Credit constraints and uncertainty were  reported to be a drag on commercial construction and leasing activity in the Philadelphia, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts.     Banking and Finance Lending activity fell further on  net, with mixed results across Districts and loan categories.  Demand for commercial and industrial loans  was reported to be lower in most Districts, although Philadelphia reported  recent growth in this category.  Consumer  loan demand also fell in general, although Cleveland reported that it was ""stable to up""  during the reporting period.  Demand for  new mortgages remained depressed, but New    York, Cleveland,  and Richmond noted  that refinancing activity continued at high levels or increased further.  Boston  and Cleveland  reported that loan demand and the availability of funds were more favorable for  community banks than for institutions with a national scope.   The availability of credit generally remained tight.  Lenders continued to impose strict standards  for all types of loans, with scattered reports of further tightening and  particular scrutiny focused on construction projects and commercial real estate  transactions.  Despite stringent  standards, Atlanta  and Chicago  noted that funds were available for well-qualified applicants, and Dallas cited contacts who  reported that capital has become more readily available.  Credit quality fell for all loan categories,  with declines cited by most Districts with the notable exception of Kansas  City, where current loan quality was unchanged and expectations for future  quality improved modestly.  New York reported that  the deterioration in quality was most pronounced for consumer loans, while Chicago emphasized  deterioration in the quality of business loans as a result of rising  bankruptcies.  Scattered reports  suggested improved liquidity in some credit markets and reductions in interest  spreads, with Chicago  noting that conditions for the commercial paper and corporate bond markets  ""improved significantly.""   Agriculture and Natural Resources  Conditions weakened for agricultural  producers in various Districts, as demand fell and growing conditions were  mixed.  Sales slowed for a variety of tree  and row crops, grains, dairy products, and livestock, and some product prices declined  significantly.  Dallas and Atlanta reported that sales were undermined  by a drop in overseas demand, and the latter District also faced a sharp  decline in demand for peanuts resulting from a recent salmonella outbreak at a  processing plant.  Planting and growing  conditions were mixed within and across Districts, with adequate moisture and favorable  temperatures reported for many areas but ongoing drought conditions and  restricted water supplies noted by Dallas  and San Francisco.  Producers benefited from declining input  prices on net, but these were not large enough to offset slower sales and lower  product prices, which put downward pressure on profit margins and land values,  according to Chicago  and Kansas City.  Activity slowed significantly for producers  of natural resource products.  Reduced  global demand and lower prices for oil have prompted a sharp cutback in oil  extraction activity since last fall, with Dallas  noting an ""unprecedented"" decline in the domestic rig count that was largely  concentrated in their District.   Respondents from the Kansas City District expect oil extraction activity  to fall further as the year proceeds, and Minneapolis  noted that natural gas and mining activities also faltered during the reporting  period.  Prices and Wages       Upward price pressures were very  limited during the reporting period, as a result of lower energy and commodity  prices and weak demand for final goods and services across a wide range of  sectors.  The lower prices of energy and  raw materials generally were passed on and contributed to downward pressure on  the final prices of various products, according to Chicago and Dallas.  Prices dropped on selected retail items in  the Philadelphia, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, as  discounting was widespread.  Selected  food products were a notable exception to downward price pressures, with Philadelphia reporting  that some food processors raised their product prices.  Gas prices rose, but according to Chicago and San Francisco the  increase was not large enough to substantially offset the ongoing effects of the  net decline from last year's highs.   Upward wage pressures eased in all  Districts, as a rising incidence of hiring freezes and continued job cuts  increased the degree of labor market slack.   Contacts from various Districts pointed to a higher incidence of wage  freezes resulting from the added slack, with a few noting outright wage reductions.  Some employers also reduced compensation by lowering  benefit costs, including reduced contributions to employee retirement programs,  according to the Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco  Districts.",2009-03-04
57,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas based on information collected on or before April 6, 2009. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.   Reports from the Federal Reserve Banks indicate that overall economic activity contracted further or remained weak. However, five of the twelve Districts noted a moderation in the pace of decline, and several saw signs that activity in some sectors was stabilizing at a low level. Manufacturing activity weakened across a broad range of industries in most Districts, with only a few exceptions. Nonfinancial service activity continued to contract across Districts. Retail spending remained sluggish, although some Districts noted a slight improvement in sales compared with the previous reporting period. Residential real estate markets continued to be weak. Home prices and construction were still falling in most areas, but better-than-expected buyer traffic led to a scattered pickup in sales in a number of Districts. Nonresidential real estate conditions continued to deteriorate. Difficulty obtaining commercial real estate financing was constraining construction and investment activity. Spending on business travel declined as corporations cut back. Reports on tourism were mixed. Bankers reported tight credit conditions, rising delinquencies, and some deterioration of loan quality. Agricultural conditions were generally favorable across Districts, although drought conditions persisted in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts. The Districts reporting on energy said reduced demand, high inventories, and lower prices led to steep cutbacks in oil and natural gas drilling and production activity. The Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts noted declines in employment in the oil and gas extraction industry. Downward pressure on prices was reported across Districts. Wage and salary pressures eased as labor markets weakened in all Districts, and many contacts continued to report job cuts and wage and hiring freezes. Employment continued to decline across a range of industries, with only scattered reports of hiring. Manufacturing Manufacturing activity continued to decline in most Districts and across a wide range of industries. Several reports, however, noted that the pace of decline had slowed or that factory activity had stabilized. The Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts cited decreases in production. The Chicago and Kansas City Districts said declines in production had slowed. The Cleveland District noted some leveling off in declines in new orders, and the New York and Dallas Districts noted that demand was beginning to bottom out following steep declines. Orders and shipments of capital goods, autos, paper, and construction-related equipment and products such as metals, wood products, lumber and electrical machinery remained mostly sluggish and below year-ago levels, with the Chicago District noting an increase in order cancellations and deferral requests. Aircraft makers in the Chicago District noted declines in demand, while aerospace manufacturers in the San Francisco District reported that a drop in airline passenger traffic and cargo capacity had spurred order cancellations and delivery deferrals. In contrast, orders and sales of high-tech equipment firmed somewhat at very weak levels in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts. Defense firms in the Boston and Cleveland Districts reported solid activity. Food manufacturers saw sales gains in the Philadelphia and San Francisco Districts, and a food manufacturer in the St. Louis District noted plans to open a new plant. Pharmaceutical firms in the Boston and Chicago Districts continued to see solid demand; petrochemical producers in the Dallas District noted a slight turnaround in operating rates. Manufacturers' assessments of future factory activity improved marginally over the survey period as well, with contacts in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts noting a slight upturn in the outlook for production and sales. Capital expenditure plans remained on hold across most regions, and the Boston, Philadelphia, and Cleveland Districts noted cuts in capital budgets. Nonfinancial Services Districts that report on nonfinancial business services said demand continued to fall across most industries. Providers of health-care services noted further declines in activity, and contacts in several Districts noted demand for professional services, such as architecture, business consulting and legal services, remained weak. Demand for IT services was mixed. Among service firms, there were reports of customers delaying payments or asking for price reductions, and receivables were harder to collect. While there were scattered reports of optimism, temporary staffing firms generally continued to report weak conditions. Firms in the Dallas District were not renewing contracts on current personnel, and the New York District characterized the supply of available workers as ""inexhaustible."" Shipping activity continued to fall over the past six weeks as both domestic and international demand remained dampened. Contacts in several Districts said shipments of construction-related manufacturing products continued to drop at a substantial pace. Consumer Spending and Tourism Consumer spending remained generally weak. However, several Districts said sales rose slightly or declines moderated compared with the previous survey period. In particular, the Boston, Cleveland, and Chicago Districts reported an improvement in sales. Purchases of big ticket and luxury items continued to decline while spending on food and necessities fared better. The Philadelphia, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported that consumers were looking for value, and were opting for lower-priced, private label products over higher-priced alternatives. Retailers kept inventories lean, in line with the slow pace of sales, and most expect demand to stay at current low levels over the next few months. Auto dealers continued to struggle, and overall vehicle sales were sluggish in all reporting Districts as weak demand and tight credit continued to limit sales. Used vehicle sales improved slightly in the Boston, Cleveland, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, but new car sales remained feeble. Dealers in the Philadelphia District reported difficulty in obtaining financing for inventory purchases, and a few dealerships in the St. Louis District went out of business, but dealers in the Cleveland District reported minimal problems with floor-plan financing. While auto dealers in the Boston, Cleveland, and Kansas City Districts noted some improvements in the outlook, those in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts expect continued weakness. Travel and tourism activity contracted further in several reporting Districts, as households and businesses continued to scale back on discretionary and travel spending. Tourist spending in the New York, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts saw double-digit declines compared with the prior year. Airlines in the Dallas District and hotel contacts in the Kansas City District reported weakening demand for business travel, while the Atlanta District noted convention cancellations. Restaurants continued to see sluggish activity in the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts, which prompted further layoffs and closures in the latter region. In contrast, mountain resorts in the Richmond District said ski season demand was on par with last year, and cruise liners in the Atlanta District reported that deep discounting spurred bookings. Real Estate and Construction Housing markets remained depressed overall, but there were some signs that conditions may be stabilizing. Many Districts said factors such as homebuyer tax credits, low mortgage rates, and more affordable prices led to a rising number of potential buyers. The Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts noted a modest improvement in sales in some areas. New home construction activity fell further, however, as inventories remained elevated. Nonetheless, several Districts, including Atlanta and Kansas City, said that inventories of unsold homes had turned down slightly. Home prices continued to decline in most Districts, although a few reports noted that prices were unchanged or that the pace of decline had eased. Low mortgage rates were fueling refinancing activity. Outlooks for the housing sector were generally more optimistic than in earlier surveys, with respondents hopeful that increased buyer interest would lead to better sales. Nonresidential real estate conditions continued to deteriorate over the past six weeks. Demand for office, industrial and retail space continued to fall, and there were reports of increases in sublease space. Rental concessions were rising. Property values moved lower as reality ""set in."" Construction activity continues to slow, and several Districts noted increased postponement of both private and public projects. Nonresidential construction is expected to decline through year-end, although there were some hopeful reports that the stimulus package may lead to some improvement. Commercial real estate investment activity weakened further. Contacts said a decline in credit availability and markdowns on commercial property were keeping buyers and sellers on the sidelines. Banking and Finance Most Districts reported weaker loan demand overall, but the reports were mixed across loan categories. In particular, the New York, Richmond, and Kansas City Districts noted an increase in residential real estate loans. Additionally, residential refinancing activity remained brisk, although the loan process was taking longer due to more stringent appraisals and underwriting standards. Demand for commercial and industrial loans was weak, and there were several reports that business borrowers were postponing capital expenditures. Commercial real estate lending continued to decline. Credit availability generally remained very tight across regions. A number of Districts reported deteriorating loan quality and rising delinquencies for all types of loan categories. In particular, several reports noted more stringent requirements for commercial real estate loans due to worries of worsening loan quality in the sector. Agriculture and Natural Resources Most regions reported improved planting and growing conditions, with the exception of the Dallas and San Francisco Districts, which are experiencing ongoing drought. Although beneficial, rainfall delayed field preparations for spring planting in the Richmond and Chicago Districts. Contacts in the Chicago District reported that producers had benefited from falling input prices, which are helping farmers obtain loans. Livestock producers in the Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts continued to be challenged by weak demand and low prices. Low milk prices have resulted in significant financial losses for dairy farmers in the Chicago and Dallas Districts, and have caused producers in the latter region to reduce their dairy cow herds. Reduced demand, rising inventories, and lower prices for oil and natural gas led to further declines in energy sector activity. Drilling activity fell sharply in the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts; respondents in the Atlanta and San Francisco Districts reported decreases as well. The Dallas District noted that the number of working U.S. rigs contracted by 300, and more than half of the decline was in Texas. In contrast, production was stable in the Cleveland District; gold mining is strong and wind energy projects moved ahead as planned in the Minneapolis District. Consistent with falling activity, the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts noted further layoffs in oil and gas extraction. Looking forward, energy contacts in the Cleveland District said that they intend to lower capital spending over the next few months. Prices Districts that report on prices noted downward pressures. Oil prices rose during the survey period, although most other commodity prices were stable to down. Manufacturers noted declines in the cost of raw materials and inputs, and product prices were generally said to be steady to down. Significant discounting was reported among retailers, and there were numerous examples of service providers reducing fees. In particular, accounting and legal firms in the Dallas District were responding to customer requests for lower fees, while the San Francisco District found prices were declining for professional services and lodging. Transportation service contacts noted a reduction in prices.  Labor Markets and Wages Labor market conditions were weak and reports of layoffs, reductions in work hours, temporary factory shutdowns, branch closures and hiring freezes remained widespread across Districts. Staffing firms in the New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas Districts reported that demand for workers remained sluggish. The manufacturing and energy extraction sectors were the most affected but there were numerous reports of job cuts in the retail and services industries as well. The St. Louis District reported payroll declines in information and medical services, while the Cleveland District cited layoffs in transportation and financial services. The Dallas District noted further cuts in the real estate and construction industry; layoffs at major financial firms continued in the New York District; and the Philadelphia District reported that unpaid furloughs had been instituted by state and local governments. In contrast, Districts including Cleveland, Chicago, and Minneapolis reported some hiring in healthcare. Contacts in the Richmond District noted solid demand for technically-skilled professionals and IT and office-support workers. The Chicago and Dallas Districts saw a slight uptick in hiring of finance personnel due to the sharp increase in mortgage refinance activity. The St. Louis District reported that a food manufacturer and some wood and plastic manufacturers planned on expanding their operations and hiring additional staff. The employment outlook is generally bleak. Contacts in several Districts have instituted hiring freezes and anticipate further cuts in jobs and work hours. Continuing layoffs, furloughs and hiring freezes kept wage pressures minimal. Contacts from a broad range of industries reported pay freezes, with some noting salary reductions. The Minneapolis District reported that unionized faculty at Minnesota's technical and community colleges had tentatively accepted a two-year pay freeze. Contacts in the Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts reported cuts in certain non-wage employment benefits, including cuts in bonuses, elimination or suspension of employer contributions to employee retirement programs, and increases in copayments on employer sponsored healthcare plans.",2009-04-15
58,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland based on information collected on or before June 1, 2009. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.   Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve District Banks indicate that economic conditions remained weak or deteriorated further during the period from mid-April through May. However, five of the Districts noted that the downward trend is showing signs of moderating. Further, contacts from several Districts said that their expectations have improved, though they do not see a substantial increase in economic activity through the end of the year. Manufacturing activity declined or remained at a low level across most Districts. However, several Districts also reported that the outlook by manufacturers has improved somewhat. Demand for nonfinancial services contracted across Districts reporting on this segment. Retail spending remained soft as consumers focused on purchasing less expensive necessities and shied away from buying luxury goods. New car purchases remained depressed, with several Districts indicating that tight credit conditions were hampering auto sales. Travel and tourism activity also declined. A number of Districts reported an uptick in home sales, and many said that new home construction appeared to have stabilized at very low levels. Vacancy rates for commercial properties were rising in many parts of the country, while developers are finding financing for new commercial projects increasingly difficult to obtain. Most Districts reported that overall lending activity was stable or weak, but with mixed results across loan categories. Credit conditions remained stringent or tightened further. Energy activity continued to weaken across most Districts, and demand for natural resources remained depressed. Planting and growing conditions varied across Districts as did agricultural input costs. Labor market conditions continued to be weak across the country, with wages generally remaining flat or falling. Two Districts also mentioned employers' plans to scale back employee benefit programs. The Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts reported that some state and local governments faced hiring freezes or outright job cuts. While manufacturing employment levels remained low, some Districts saw signs that job losses may be moderating. With few exceptions, Districts reported that prices at all stages of production were generally flat or falling. The notable exception to the downward pressure on prices was the widely-reported increase in oil prices. Manufacturing Manufacturing declined or remained weak in most Districts. Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis reported declines in activity, while production remained at very low levels in the San Francisco District. Atlanta and Kansas City indicated that the pace of the decline in manufacturing had moderated or slowed. New York characterized the sector as having stabilized, while Dallas mentioned signs of stabilization. In contrast, Richmond reported a rise in both new orders and shipments. Philadelphia reported that the primary metals, machinery, and electrical equipment industries remain especially weak, and Cleveland noted that steel shipments continue at depressed levels. Chicago commented that, apart from Asia, export demand was weak. Dallas reported that construction-related manufacturing and the petrochemicals markets remained weak, while San Francisco stated that activity in the wood products industry was depressed and that demand in the metal fabrication industry was extremely weak. Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis and Dallas all noted weakness in automotive-related industries.  In contrast, Boston, Dallas, and San Francisco indicated that high technology industries experienced some increase in activity, and Richmond noted strengthening across a number of industries. Several Districts also reported that the outlook of manufacturers has improved somewhat, though Boston, Cleveland and Kansas City mentioned that capital spending was weak. Nonfinancial Services Districts reporting on nonfinancial services indicated that for the most part activity continued to decline. Looking at some specific sectors, providers of health-care services spoke of job cuts and lower patient volumes. Activity continued to weaken or remain soft for providers of professional services such as accounting, architecture, business consulting, and legal services. In contrast, San Francisco reported a substantial pickup in real estate services such as title insurance due to an increase in home refinancing. Activity in IT services varied, with New England firms experiencing declining revenue and business, while demand for IT workers in Richmond and Chicago was reportedly  on the rise. High-tech service sales in Kansas City increased moderately, and demand there is expected to strengthen. Transportation contacts in most Districts say that shipping volume either remained at low levels or continued to decline. Contacts in the Cleveland District generally stated that while shipping volumes remain down across all market segments, the steep drop-off earlier this year has abated. Cargo and container trade in Richmond and Dallas remains at low levels, but contacts noted signs of improvement in import and export activity. Consumer Spending and Tourism Consumer spending remained soft as households focused on purchasing less expensive necessities. Reports from New York, Minneapolis, and Dallas indicated a modest rise in sales, while retail purchases in Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco were flat or mixed. The other Districts experienced declining sales. Several Districts reported that discounters have seen their sales increase, while purchases of luxury goods continued to weaken. Respondents from Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas expect soft consumer sales to persist. Purchases of new cars remained depressed across most Districts. However, Chicago saw a small increase in auto sales, which respondents attributed to incentives and promotions. New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Kansas City indicated that tight credit conditions hampered auto sales. Reports from Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco indicate that sales of used vehicles are rising. Travel and tourism activity declined, and vacationers are tending to spend less. Business at Manhattan hotels and Broadway theaters, which had increased modestly in April, fell back in May. Bookings at resorts in the Richmond District are starting to pick up; however, they are weaker than a year ago. In the Atlanta District, promotions and discounting were said to have played a significant role in keeping theme park attendance and cruise bookings stable. Contacts from the San Francisco District said that pronounced declines in hotel occupancy rates, especially luxury hotels, were ongoing, while travel in some parts of the District remained down at double-digit rates from the previous year. However, a report from the Minneapolis District indicated that summer reservations at campgrounds and resorts are strong. Real Estate and Construction Although the residential real estate market remains weak, agents in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported an uptick in home sales. The reasons cited include seasonal factors, low interest rates, declining house prices, and tax credits for first-time buyers. Much of the sales increase was found in the lower-priced end of the market. New home construction appeared to have stabilized at very low levels in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco, although Kansas City reported an uptick in construction. Home inventories were trending down in Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas. However, Chicago reported that inventories remain elevated. Commercial real estate markets continued to weaken across all Districts. Vacancy rates for commercial properties were rising in many regions of the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts putting downward pressure on rents. Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis reported new construction projects being postponed or cancelled, and new construction in the New York, Philadelphia, and Minneapolis Districts dropped substantially. Eight Districts cited difficulty in obtaining financing as one of the primary reasons for delaying or stopping construction of new developments and for limiting sales of existing properties. Banking and Finance Most Districts reported that overall lending activity was stable or weak, but with mixed results across loan categories. Demand for commercial and industrial loans fell in New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, and San Francisco. Boston, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas singled out commercial real estate as experiencing weakening demand. Boston reported that commercial real estate transactions were increasingly scarce, and Dallas noted that loan renewals in this category required more borrower equity and smaller loan sizes than in the past. Atlanta and Chicago reported limited credit availability for vehicle dealers and other businesses tied to the auto industry. Demand for mortgage refinancing loans was mixed. New York and Cleveland reported strong demand for these loans, while Richmond noted a waning of residential refinancing demand due to rising interest rates. Richmond also reported an uptick in demand for purchase mortgage loans. Most Districts said that credit conditions remained stringent or tightened further. Reports from Philadelphia and Cleveland expected that credit will remain tight in the near term. The credit quality of loan applicants and existing clients showed deterioration in Philadelphia, Richmond, Cleveland, and Dallas, although Richmond noted that the rate of deterioration has slowed. New York and Cleveland said that delinquencies had increased across numerous loan categories, particularly those tied to real estate. Cleveland and Kansas City reported increases in bank deposits, with the latter attributing the rise to uncertainty about financial markets. Agriculture and Natural Resources Planting and growing conditions varied across Districts, with favorable developments in Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas. However, a drought hindered Oklahoma's wheat crop and livestock production in Southwest Texas. Above-normal rainfall delayed planting of major crops in the Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts. Storms in the Minneapolis District destroyed fields and led to higher-than-normal deaths in calving. The Chicago and Kansas City Districts both said that lower cattle and hog prices along with higher feed costs have worsened the income prospect for livestock producers. Input costs in San Francisco, though, have stayed at moderate levels, and sales have continued at a solid pace for most types of agricultural output. Energy activity continued to weaken across most Districts, and demand for natural resources remained depressed. Coal production and prices fell substantially in the Cleveland District. The number of drilling rigs operating in the Kansas City District is sixty percent below its peak last fall, and working rigs in Texas have fallen fifteen percent over the past six weeks as global demand for oil remains low. However, one production facility in the Gulf of Mexico just opened in May and is expected to make a major contribution to oil and natural gas output once it reaches full production. Wind energy projects expanded in the Kansas City and Minneapolis Districts. Employment and Wages Labor market conditions continued to be weak across the country, with wages generally remaining flat or falling. Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco reported that businesses were cutting or freezing wages, and Boston cited wage freezes in the retail sector. The Chicago District reported that the downward pressure on wages was abating somewhat there, as firms turned instead to cutting hours or jobs outright to contain labor costs. Firms in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts also reported having to cut hours to reduce costs. In addition, the Boston and San Francisco Districts also mentioned employers' plans to scale back employee benefit programs. In the service sector, the Boston and Cleveland Districts reported relatively stable retail employment, while the Richmond District reported continuing reductions. The Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts noted that firms providing professional services, such as accounting, consulting, and legal services, continued to report staff reductions, while the Boston and New York Districts reported weak demand for financial services workers, with ongoing layoffs at large financial firms. The Boston and Richmond Districts also reported reductions in information technology jobs. The Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts reported that some state and local governments faced hiring freezes or outright job cuts. In manufacturing, while employment levels remained low, several Districts saw signs that job losses may be moderating. The New York, Richmond, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts all reported less severe employment reductions in recent weeks, with some optimism that manufacturing employment levels may soon stabilize. This, however, was balanced by reports of ongoing manufacturing employment losses in the Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts. Staffing services firms reported some modest signs of recovery, with the Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas Districts all reporting some stabilization in activity or a slight improvement in employment trends. The Cleveland and Richmond Districts, however, continued to report that activity among staffing services firms was weak. Prices With few exceptions, the District Banks reported that prices at all stages of production were generally flat or falling. Manufacturers in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco said that overall input prices were stable or declining, although in Kansas City those declines were said to be moderating. In contrast, Richmond noted that prices of raw materials had increased at a quicker pace. The notable exception to the downward pressure on input prices was oil. Increases in oil prices were widely reported. However, prices for other energy commodities, like coal and natural gas, remained relatively low. Other exceptions to the prevailing price trend included agricultural items. The Atlanta and Kansas City Districts reported some increases in agricultural prices, with the latter noting that these higher prices were partly driven by global weather concerns. The Chicago and Kansas City Districts also reported higher prices for livestock feed. In construction, the Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Minneapolis Districts reported higher prices for some building supplies, perhaps related to increase in petroleum prices. Reports from a number of Districts indicated that pricing at retail remains very soft. The Cleveland and Dallas Districts indicated that retail prices were stable, San Francisco said that they were held down by discounting, and Philadelphia noted that steady input costs were holding retail prices in check. In Kansas City, retail prices were declining and expected to soften further. Richmond's retail prices continued to rise, albeit more slowly than in the past.",2009-06-10
59,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and based on information collected on or before July 20, 2009.  This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.  Reports from the 12 Federal Reserve Districts suggest that economic activity continued to be weak going into the summer, but most Districts indicated that the pace of decline has moderated since the last report or that activity has begun to stabilize, albeit at a low level.  Five Districts used the words ""slow"", ""subdued"", or ""weak"" to describe activity levels; Chicago and St. Louis reported that the pace of decline appeared to be moderating; and New York, Cleveland, Kansas City, and San Francisco pointed to signs of stabilization.  Minneapolis said the District economy had contracted since the last report. Most Districts reported sluggish retail activity.  Cleveland, Richmond, and Minneapolis noted further declines in sales, although results were somewhat mixed or positive according to retailers in the Boston, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts.  Manufacturing activity showed some improvement in the Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts; while St. Louis and Dallas reported some moderation of declines; Philadelphia and Minneapolis saw activity decrease; and most other Districts indicated that manufacturing activity continued at low levels.  Boston, Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco reported contractions in services industries.  Banking sectors in the New York, Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts experienced weaker demand for some categories of loans.  Residential real estate markets stayed soft in most Districts, although many noted some signs of improvement.  By contrast, commercial real estate markets weakened further in recent months in two-thirds of the Districts and remained slow in the others. Districts reported varied--but generally modest--price changes across sectors and products, with competitive pressures damping increases; however, Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas noted that some metals prices have increased in recent months.  Most Districts indicated that labor markets were extremely soft, with minimal wage pressures, and cited the use of various methods of reducing compensation in addition to, or instead of, freezing or cutting wages. Consumer Spending and Tourism Consumer spending in the early summer remained below previous-year levels in most Districts, as households continued to be price conscious.  Boston, Kansas City, and San Francisco experienced either modest sales increases or less negative sales results than in recent reporting periods.  Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis, New York, and Dallas cited flat or mixed sales, while sales in the remaining Districts remained soft.  Several Districts noted that consumers focused on purchasing less expensive necessities, while sales of big ticket items languished.  Retailers in Boston, Philadelphia, and Dallas characterized their outlook as cautious. Auto sales were mixed across the country.  Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City saw modest increases in car sales, while New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Atlanta continued to experience subdued sales.  The exception was sales of used vehicles, which continued to be strong or were strengthening, according to Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Travel and tourism declined in the majority of Districts.  The San Francisco District observed a sharp drop in luxury and business travel, while tourism activity in New York City was weak but stable since the last Beige Book report.  Tourism contacts along the Atlantic coast reported that with the exception of July 4th holiday bookings, business was generally weaker than a year ago.  Hotel room rates have declined in several Districts. Nonfinancial Services District reports regarding nonfinancial services industries were largely negative, although they included a few bright spots.  The Minneapolis, St. Louis, and Dallas Districts indicated that demand for professional services such as business support, architecture, and legal services continued to decline or remained soft.  By contrast, reports from the healthcare sector were largely positive, with the San Francisco, Minneapolis, and Richmond Districts citing steady to increased demand for medical services, and the Atlanta, Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas Districts reporting hiring activity in health care.  Technology-related firms in the Kansas City District also reported heightened activity, especially in the clean technology and defense-driven aerospace markets.  Richmond and Minneapolis noted increased demand for information technology workers, and Atlanta saw hiring activity in the defense and aerospace industry.  Staffing industry contacts in numerous Districts suggested a higher demand for temporary or part-time workers over permanent hires, and Atlanta noted that employers were taking advantage of a higher supply of skilled labor to improve the quality of their workforces.  Nearly all Districts reporting on transportation services observed continued weakness.  Freight transport respondents from the Atlanta, Dallas, and Cleveland Districts noted that cargo volumes remain below year-earlier levels.  While Cleveland contacts reported that competitive shipping rates are being maintained, trucking contacts from the Atlanta District noted that an oversupply of trucks relative to demand has exerted downward pressure on rates.  A few Districts also reported reduced airline traffic, especially amongst business travelers.   Manufacturing Reports on the manufacturing sector remained subdued but were slightly more positive than in the previous Beige Book.  Many Districts characterized manufacturing activity as remaining depressed but with selected signs of modest improvement.  Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Atlanta, and St. Louis reported decreased manufacturing activity; however, the latter two Districts noted that the overall rate of decline abated in the latest reporting period.  Richmond and Kansas City reported rising manufacturing activity, albeit chiefly in nondurables industries.  Districts attributed some of the recent increases in production to replenishment of finished-goods or customer inventories. Chicago indicated that the quick resolutions of the Chrysler and GM bankruptcies have boosted business confidence, and that automakers were scheduling a pickup in production for July.  However, ongoing shutdowns of domestic auto plants have led to precariously low business volumes for parts suppliers, according to Chicago and St. Louis.  Steel production remained depressed but has leveled off or increased somewhat, according to Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis.  Similarly, Dallas observed that refineries increased their capacity utilization slightly over the past six weeks, but that overall industry conditions remain weak because of low demand for fuels.  Various District reports noted cancellations of orders for commercial aircraft and continued weak demand for most types of equipment and machinery.  Among the positive developments in manufacturing, several Districts mentioned pickups in technology sectors, or cited strong or rising sales of military products or pharmaceuticals. Comments on the near-term outlook varied across Districts, but on the whole they appear consistent with a forecast of modest and uneven recovery in manufacturing output beginning during roughly the coming six to twelve months.  New York, Philadelphia, and Atlanta indicated that manufacturers have a generally positive or improved near-term outlook.  Dallas reported that high-tech manufacturers ""are seeing some upside potential in their forecasts instead of just down-side risks,"" but that construction-related manufacturers ""expect no improvement in the near term.""  Boston indicated that many respondents expect continued sub-par revenue numbers for the remainder of the year, but ""look forward to slowly improving business in 2010,"" while Cleveland and Kansas City reported that manufacturing contacts expect little or no change in demand through the end of 2009. Real Estate and Construction Commercial real estate leasing markets were described as either ""weak"" or ""slow"" in all 12 Districts, although the severity of the downturn varied somewhat across Districts.  While the office vacancy rate was up and rents were down in the Dallas District, market fundamentals there remained stronger than the national average.  Market conditions in the New York District are significantly worse than one year ago, on average, but have been relatively stable in recent weeks and some parts of the District report improving fundamentals.  Office vacancy rates continued to climb in the Atlanta, Boston, Kansas City, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Richmond, and San Francisco Districts, as well as in Manhattan, resulting in sizable leasing concessions and/or declines in asking rents.  Significant weakness in the retail leasing sector was reported for the Boston, Minneapolis, and New York Districts, and industrial vacancy increased in the Atlanta, Dallas, Minneapolis, and St. Louis Districts.  Commercial real estate sales volume remained low, even ""non-existent"" in some Districts, reportedly due to a combination of tight credit and weak demand.  Construction activity was limited and/or declining in most Districts, although exceptions were noted for health and institutional construction in the St. Louis District, public sector construction in the Chicago District, and the reconstruction of the World Trade Center in Manhattan.  Tight credit was cited as an ongoing factor in the dearth of new construction activity.  The commercial real estate outlook was mixed, both within and across Districts.  Some contacts expect commercial real estate markets to improve within two quarters and others predict further market deterioration for the remainder of 2009 and possibly through late 2010. Residential real estate markets in most Districts remained weak, but many reported signs of improvement.  The Minneapolis and San Francisco Districts cited large increases in home sales compared with 2008 levels, and other Districts reported rising sales in some submarkets.  Of the areas that continued to experience year-over-year sales declines, all except St Louis--where sales were down steeply--also reported that the pace of decline was moderating.  In general, the low end of the market, especially entry-level homes, continued to perform relatively well; contacts in the New York, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts attributed this relative strength, at least in part, to the first-time homebuyer tax credit.  Condo sales were still far below year-before levels according to the Boston and New York reports.  In general, home prices continued to decline in most markets, although a number of Districts saw possible signs of stabilization.  The Boston, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts mentioned that the increasing number of foreclosure sales was exerting downward pressure on home prices.  Residential construction reportedly remains quite slow, with the Chicago, Cleveland, and Kansas City Districts noting that financing is difficult. Agriculture and Natural ResourcesThe farm sector reported better weather in much of the country in June and early July.  As a result, the supply and condition of many crops have improved, and prices have fallen.  In the Richmond and Atlanta Districts, generally favorable weather has facilitated the vegetable, small grain or fruit harvest--much of which is in good condition.  Similarly, contacts in several Districts including Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City indicated that the size and condition of the corn, soybean and/or rice crops have improved and that farmers are now planning to harvest more acres than previously expected; thus, prices and profits are--and for the short term are expected to remain--down.  By contrast, the production of wheat or barley is expected to fall well below strong 2008 levels in the St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts.  In the Dallas District, where a drought continues, much of the corn, cotton, and other crops were described as ""not worth harvesting,"" and producers are collecting insurance.   Livestock contacts in the Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts report that prices for dairy, hogs, and cattle have fallen by more than operating costs and some ranchers are liquidating herds.  In the Chicago District, livestock operations have reportedly lost their cash cushion and have been unable to get financing; contacts in Dallas, where the ongoing drought has destroyed forage, also note concerns about ranchers' cash flow. With oil prices up to $70 per barrel in the first half of 2009 but recently trending down, oil production was reportedly flat in June and early July in the Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts and up slightly in Dallas and San Francisco.  Contacts in Atlanta indicate that the number of rigs operating in the Gulf of Mexico had fallen by half year over year while in Dallas the number of working rigs was up slightly.  Natural gas prices continue to fall, discouraging drilling in the Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts.  Kansas City energy producers report financial strains and are cutting headcounts selectively, while contacts in Dallas observe much excess capacity and weak demand for energy services.  In response to weak demand from the utilities, coal prices in the Cleveland District have fallen 50 percent since early 2009, and coal production, jobs and hours are down; capital spending has fallen to minimum maintenance levels.  In Minneapolis, by contrast, new wind projects have been announced. Banking and Financial ServicesIn most reporting Districts, overall lending activity was stable or weakened further for most loan categories.  In contrast, Philadelphia reported a slight increase in business, consumer, and residential real estate lending.  As businesses remained pessimistic and reluctant to borrow, demand for commercial and industrial loans continued to fall or stay weak in the New York, Richmond, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts.  Consumer loan demand decreased in New York, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco, stabilized at a low level in Chicago and Dallas, and was steady to up in Cleveland. Residential real estate lending decreased in New York, Richmond, and St. Louis.  Dallas reported steady but low outstanding mortgage volumes, while Kansas City noted that the rise in mortgage loans slowed.  Refinancing activity fell dramatically in Richmond, decreased in New York and Cleveland, and maintained its pace in Dallas.  Bankers in the New York District indicated no change in delinquency rates in all loan categories except residential mortgages, while Cleveland, Atlanta, and San Francisco reported rising delinquencies on loans linked to real estate. Banks continued to tighten credit standards in the New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts; and some have stepped up the requirements for the commercial real estate category, in particular, due to concern over declining loan quality.  Meanwhile, Cleveland and Atlanta reported that higher credit standards remained in place, with no change expected in the near term.  Credit quality deteriorated in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Kansas City, and San Francisco, while loan quality exceeded expectations in Chicago and remained steady in Richmond. Employment, Wages, and PricesAll Districts indicated that labor markets remain slack, with most sectors either reducing jobs or holding them steady and aggregate employment continuing to decline, on net.  However, Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis noted selective hiring, including attempts by some firms to take advantage of layoffs elsewhere to pick up experienced talent.  Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas cited moderation in the pace of manufacturing employment decline since the last report, and New York noted some signs of labor market stabilization.  But Atlanta reported further deterioration in labor market conditions and additional job cuts already planned for coming months. The weakness of labor markets has virtually eliminated upward wage pressure, and wages and compensation are steady or falling in most Districts; however, Boston cited some manufacturing and business services firms raising pay selectively, and Minneapolis said wage increases were moderate.  Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco cited a range of methods firms are using to limit compensation, including cutting or freezing wages or benefit contributions, deferral of future salary increases, trimming bonuses and travel allowances, reducing hours, temporary shutdowns, periodic furloughs, and unpaid vacations. Most Districts reported that upward price pressures were minimal.  Manufacturers in the Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts indicated that most materials costs were flat or down; however, several Districts mentioned price increases for some metals, petrochemicals, and building materials.  While the Boston, New York, and Kansas City reports say a few firms are making modest price increases stick, selling prices of most manufacturers and retailers were reportedly held down by competitive pressures.  Services firms have increased discounting and/or cut fees, according to contacts in Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco, while Richmond indicated price increases for services were mild.",2009-07-29
60,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and based on information collected before August 31, 2009. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.   Reports from the 12 Federal Reserve Districts indicate that economic activity continued to stabilize in July and August.  Relative to the last report, Dallas indicated that economic activity had firmed, while Boston, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Richmond, and San Francisco mentioned signs of improvement.  Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and New York generally described economic activity as stable or showing signs of stabilization; St. Louis remarked that the pace of decline appeared to be moderating.  Most Districts noted that the outlook for economic activity among their business contacts remained cautiously positive. The majority of Districts reported flat retail sales.  Richmond, Philadelphia, Chicago, Atlanta, and Boston remarked that retailers continued to carefully manage inventories, keeping them in line with low sales levels. A majority of Districts confirmed that the ""cash-for-clunkers"" program boosted traffic and sales.  Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Minneapolis also noted increases or planned increases in automobile-related production.  Most regions reported some improvement in residential real estate markets.  Downward pressure on home prices continued in most Districts, although Dallas and New York noted that local prices were firming.  Reports on commercial real estate suggest that the demand for space remained weak and that nonresidential construction-related activity continued to decline.  San Francisco, Philadelphia, and St. Louis noted that the demand for nonfinancial services remained soft, although the pace of the decline was described as slowing in the latter two Districts.  Loan demand was described as weak and many Districts reported that credit standards remained tight.  Most Districts reported improvements in manufacturing production.  For instance, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Cleveland, and Chicago reported moderate increases in new orders.  Labor market conditions remained weak across all Districts.  However, staffing firms in Atlanta, Dallas, Richmond, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Boston, New York, and Chicago did report a slight pickup in the demand for temporary workers. Wage pressures remained minimal across all Districts.  Consumer prices were described as being steady in most Districts, although Kansas City and San Francisco noted some downward pressure on retail prices.   Consumer Spending and Tourism Consumer spending remained soft in most Districts.  The majority of Districts reported that retail activity was flat.  Boston, Philadelphia, and Kansas City noted improvement in sales, but attributed the increase primarily to back-to-school purchases.  Philadelphia, Chicago, Cleveland, and San Francisco observed that shoppers remained focused on essentials and continued to refrain from purchasing discretionary and big-ticket items.  Kansas City and San Francisco noted weak restaurant sales.  Richmond, Philadelphia, Chicago, Atlanta, and Boston remarked that retailer inventories were being closely monitored and were keeping them in line with low sales levels.   The majority of Districts reported that the cash-for-clunkers program helped boost traffic and sales, although Cleveland and Kansas City also remarked that used car sales were adversely affected by the program.  The sustainability of the higher recent pace of new vehicle sales was questioned by industry contacts in the Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts. Tourism activity varied.  Kansas City, Minneapolis, and Richmond observed solid visitor numbers at local vacation destinations, whereas Atlanta and New York noted sluggish activity and aggressive hotel discounting.  San Francisco reported that activity in California and Nevada was weak, but visitors to Hawaii had increased. Real Estate and Construction  Residential real estate markets remained weak, but signs of improvement continued to be noted.  Chicago, Richmond, Boston, and San Francisco observed an uptick in sales over the last six weeks, while sales in the Philadelphia District were described as steady.  St. Louis commented that residential home sales had not improved.  Most Districts reported that sales remained below the levels of a year earlier.  However, Atlanta, New York, Cleveland, and Minneapolis documented some year-over-year gains in select markets.  Most Districts noted that demand remained stronger at the low-end of the housing market.  Boston, Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City, Richmond, and New York indicated that the first-time home buyer tax incentive was spurring sales.  However, Philadelphia did note an upturn in sales at the high-end of the market.  Reports on house prices generally indicated ongoing downward pressures, although Dallas and New York noted some increases.  Construction remained at low levels overall, although Chicago and Dallas reported a small increase in activity. Reports on commercial real estate markets indicated that demand for space remained weak and that construction continued to decline in all Districts.  Atlanta, Philadelphia, Richmond, and San Francisco reported that vacancy rates increased, while rates held steady in the Boston and Kansas City Districts and were mixed in New York.  Boston, Dallas, Kansas City, Philadelphia, and Richmond commented that the demand for space remained weak.  Commercial rents declined according to Boston, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond.  Rent concessions were reported in the Richmond and San Francisco markets, and Richmond noted that some landlords had postponed property improvements in an effort to conserve cash.  Construction remained at very low levels, with modest improvements noted in public construction in the Chicago, Cleveland, and Minneapolis Districts.  Nonfinancial Services    Reports on the demand for nonfinancial services were mixed.  San Francisco, Philadelphia, and St. Louis noted that the demand for service sector business remained soft, although the pace of decline was described as having slowed in the latter two Districts.  The demand for legal services remained relatively flat at low levels according to Dallas and Minneapolis.  Kansas City and Richmond cited increasing demand for technology-related services.  Healthcare services in Minneapolis also experienced an uptick in demand.  Demand for transportation services were mixed, with some Districts noting stabilization at weak levels.  Reports indicated that freight volume declines were moderating in Cleveland, while Dallas and Atlanta reported a modest pickup in rail shipments. Banking and Financial Services  Most Districts reported that loan demand was weak and that credit standards remained tight.  New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Kansas City, St. Louis, and San Francisco observed further weakening in loan demand across most categories.  Dallas noted scattered reports of improvements in loan demand.  Contacts in Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas noted an increase in demand for auto loans.  Credit standards ranged from unchanged to tighter in most Districts.  However, Chicago reported that credit conditions and availability had improved. Mortgage activity declined modestly according to the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Kansas City Districts, while Richmond reported increases attributed to improved demand for starter homes.  Dallas noted an uptick in refinancing activity.  Commercial and industrial lending declined in the Philadelphia and Kansas City regions, and was steady according to Richmond.  The lack of available credit was cited as an issue for both residential and commercial contractors in Cleveland, and for commercial real estate borrowers in Atlanta.  San Francisco reported an increase in venture capital investment. Further deterioration in credit quality was noted by Philadelphia, Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco, whereas Cleveland observed some improvement in credit quality.  Chicago also cited improvements in credit quality, apart from home equity and commercial real estate.  Dallas and Chicago noted increases in consumer bankruptcies, while rising delinquency rates were reported by New York and Cleveland. Manufacturing  Most Districts reported modest improvements in the manufacturing sector.  Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Cleveland, and Chicago all reported slight-to-moderate increases in new orders.  San Francisco indicated that new orders increased for manufacturers of semiconductors and other IT products, while orders declined for metal fabricators and petroleum refineries.  Dallas noted that orders held steady, while St. Louis reported that manufacturing output continued to decline, but at a slower pace.  Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Minneapolis reported increases or planned increases in automobile and automobile-related production.  Several Districts also noted increased production in the pharmaceutical industry. The near-term outlook among manufacturers varied, but the majority of reports indicated that manufacturers were cautiously optimistic.  Boston, New York, and Philadelphia reported that their contacts expect modest growth later this year or early 2010.  Boston noted that while its contacts generally expect modest growth, several cost control measures would remain in place.  Dallas reported increased uncertainty among construction-related manufacturers, while Cleveland noted that half of their manufacturing contacts expected weak demand into 2010. Employment, Wages, and Prices   Labor market conditions remained weak across all Districts, but several also noted an uptick in temporary hiring and a decline in the pace of layoffs.  Richmond reported that most service-providing firms continued to cut employees, while Minneapolis and New York noted additional layoffs in the manufacturing sector.  Cleveland reported modest job declines in the banking, commercial construction, and coal mining sectors.  Further job cuts are expected in auto manufacturing according to St. Louis, and Dallas indicated further staff reductions are anticipated in the airline, energy, and residential construction sectors.  Staffing firms in a majority of Districts reported a modest increase in the demand for temporary workers, although industry contacts in Boston also questioned whether these gains will persist.  New York cited a modest pickup in temporary hiring for the legal and financial industries.  Chicago noted an uptick in demand for workers in the healthcare and information technology industries.  St. Louis and Minneapolis reported that federal stimulus funds have had a positive impact on construction and local government jobs.   Wage pressures remained low across all Districts.  Several Districts noted businesses and local governments imposing wage freezes or even reducing employee compensation in some instances.  Boston noted that several manufacturers who have cut wage rates do not expect to restore pay levels until next year.  Kansas City, Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, San Francisco, Dallas, and Richmond noted an increase in the cost of some raw materials, including fuel, metals, and steel.  Chicago and Dallas mentioned that excess supply was putting substantial downward pressure on natural gas prices.  Retail prices were described as generally steady in most Districts, although Kansas City and San Francisco noted continued discounting and downward pressure on consumer prices. Agriculture and Natural Resources   Reports on agricultural activity were mixed.  Weather conditions were described as being favorable in St. Louis, Kansas City, and Atlanta.  However, cold weather, crop diseases, and drought were limiting production of corn, cotton, and soybeans in the Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts.  Drought and weak market conditions were significantly affecting livestock industries according to Kansas City and Dallas.  Dallas reported that some ranchers had liquidated portions of their cattle herds, while hog producers in the Kansas City District were said to be struggling as a result of lower pork prices. Atlanta, Dallas, Kansas City, and San Francisco noted increased oil and gas inventories as a result of reduced consumption.  Contacts in the natural gas industry noted that subdued demand continued to suppress prices and has lead to cutbacks in extraction activity.  Cleveland indicated that weak demand for electricity prompted coal producers to scale back production and capital investment.  Kansas City noted that although coal production in Wyoming had risen, it remained below year-ago levels.  Dallas and Atlanta remarked that oil and gas drilling activity continued to decline in the Gulf of Mexico, whereas Kansas City and Dallas reported that the number of rigs operating on land had increased.",2009-09-09
61,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and based on information collected before October 13, 2009.  This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.  Reports from the 12 Federal Reserve Districts indicated either stabilization or modest improvements in many sectors since the last report, albeit often from depressed levels. Leading the more positive sector reports among Districts were residential real estate and manufacturing, both of which continued a pattern of improvement that emerged over the summer. Reports on consumer spending and nonfinancial services were mixed. Commercial real estate was reported to be one of the weakest sectors, although reports of weakness or moderate decline were frequently noted in other sectors. Reports of gains in economic activity generally outnumber declines, but virtually every reference to improvement was qualified as either small or scattered. For example, Dallas cited slight improvements residential real estate and staffing firms, while New York noted gains only in a few sectors (predominantly manufacturing and retail). Retail and manufacturing conditions were mixed in Boston, but some signs of improvement were reported. New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and San Francisco cited small pickups in manufacturing activity. In the Kansas City District, an uptick was noted in technology firms, while services firms posted revenue gains in Richmond. However, conditions were referred to as stable or flat for business services and tourism firms in Minneapolis and agriculture in St. Louis and Kansas City. The weakest sector was commercial real estate, with conditions described as either weak or deteriorating across all Districts. Banking also faltered in several Districts, with Kansas City and San Francisco noting continued erosion in credit quality (often with more expected in the future). One bright spot in the banking sector was lending to new homebuyers, in response to the first-time homebuyer tax credit. Finally, labor markets were typically characterized as weak or mixed, but with occasional pockets of improvement. Districts generally reported little or no increase to either price or wage pressures, but references to downward pressures were occasionally noted. While upward price pressures were generally subdued in most Districts, materials prices increased in Cleveland (mainly for steel) and Kansas City. Manufactured goods prices were flat to up slightly in Boston. Boston reported that in some market segments ""product competition and customer clout are leading to downward pressure on prices."" Minimal wage pressures were noted in Cleveland and Minneapolis. Consumer Spending and Tourism Consumer spending remained weak in most Districts since the last report, although some improvements were noted.  Chicago reported a continued decrease but at a slower rate than in the previous reporting period, and retailers maintained low inventories. Richmond reported flat or declining sales; Dallas indicated sales were largely unchanged. However, Dallas reported unexpected weakness at value-based retailers. Sales were mixed, according to Boston, St. Louis, and Kansas City, with Kansas City citing strong sales of cold weather apparel and lower-priced goods.  San Francisco remarked that sales were little changed, with the exception of an increase in furniture sales. Although New York observed weak sales in upstate New York, general merchandise retailers in the City were ahead of plan and same-store sales were roughly on par with a year earlier. Boston noted that large-scale retailers had cut inventory due to weak sales. Philadelphia saw a pickup in back-to-school shopping. Cleveland observed that consumers were very price-sensitive and inventories were lean; nonetheless, sales were flat or slightly improved. The ""cash-for-clunkers"" program ended in August, leaving depleted inventories and slower sales in its wake. New vehicle sales declined in New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. However, Chicago reported a pick-up in vehicle sales in early October. Low new-car inventories helped to move used cars in several Districts, although San Francisco commented that the demand for used cars also weakened. New York also reported that automobile dealers saw some improvement in credit conditions for consumers looking to purchase cars. Looking to expectations for holiday sales, Chicago anticipated improved sales, while Philadelphia retailers expected consumers to limit spending. However, Third District merchants also noted that store traffic increased recently. Atlanta reported that two-thirds of contacts expected flat or declining sales over the next three months. Tourist activity varied across Districts. Boston, New York, and Atlanta described business travel as extremely soft, whereas Richmond observed solid growth in group bookings. Occupancy rates held steady in New York, spurred by increased leisure visitors, while aggressive discounting boosted cruise-line occupancy rates in Atlanta. San Francisco reported a deep slide in hotel and resort visits in Southern California and Las Vegas, but noted a continued firming of occupancy rates in Hawaii. Richmond indicated overall bookings were much improved over last year, while Kansas City reported occupancy rates remained below year-ago-levels. Room rates continued to decline in several Districts, including New York and Atlanta. In contrast, Boston said that hotels were offering dramatic promotional deals and discounts on local attractions, which preserved posted room rates. Nonfinancial Services Nonfinancial services firms had mixed reports in recent weeks. Kansas City observed increased demand for high-tech services and Richmond noted generally increased revenues, particularly in telecommunications and healthcare services. Demand for healthcare services also picked up in the Boston District. Minneapolis observed that activity in nonfinancial services firms was mostly flat at low levels, although technology consultants reported an uptick and competition heated up among engineering firms.  In contrast, San Francisco contacts indicated that demand for services in general fell, and elective medical procedures were being deferred. St. Louis noted that revenues declined at several large firms in business support services. Transportation services activity generally declined, although Cleveland and Chicago reported some strengthening. Atlanta observed weak transportation demand overall, and firms in the San Francisco District indicated that trucking had declined. Import demand in the Dallas District fell, leading to a reduction in cargo volumes at intermodal firms. Activity in the transportation sector was flat, according to Kansas City. In contrast, the cash-for-clunkers program helped to clear dealership lots, which prompted dealers to restock their depleted inventories and drove up car shipments. Chicago reported that trucking shipments increased, although the level of activity remained low, and Cleveland's contacts cited an uptick in freight transport volume in recent weeks. Cleveland also noted that trucking companies planned substantial equipment purchases through the first quarter of 2010. Business travel by air declined since the last report, according to San Francisco, while airlines in the Dallas District reported stabilized demand--albeit at low levels. Manufacturing Most Districts reported that manufacturing activity was generally stronger since the last report. New York, Richmond, Minneapolis and Kansas City all noted a further pickup in production, while Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago and San Francisco mentioned slight-to-moderate increases. Growth rates varied by industry, however, and some Districts experienced little or no overall increase. Boston reported that manufacturing activity was mixed, but had stabilized or shown modest improvement in certain industries. Similarly, Dallas said overall demand in manufacturing was flat at weak levels albeit with pickups in the high-tech, food, and petrochemical industries. St. Louis indicated that manufacturing continued its net decline, and Atlanta noted moderate declines in orders and production.  Some Districts (Boston, Richmond and Chicago) mentioned that year-over-year drops in new orders of housing-related products had abated. Cleveland, Richmond, and Chicago reported substantial increases in auto and parts production, which were attributed primarily to restocking dealers' and manufacturers' inventories.  Accordingly, lean inventories and stronger demand from the auto sector led to an increase in steel production in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts. Comments on the near-term outlook varied across Districts. Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Kansas City reported that their contacts expected only slight gains and modest economic growth during the next six months. Therefore, capital spending plans remained subdued, and centered mostly on new product development or cost reduction. Dallas indicated that planned projects and routine maintenance were being deferred to conserve capital.  New York, however, reported that respondents were increasingly optimistic about the near-term outlook and expected to hire more workers and spend more on capital. Real Estate and Construction Most Districts reported that housing market conditions improved in recent weeks, primarily from a pickup in sales of low- to middle-priced houses. Contacts reported that sales were boosted by the government's tax credit for first-time homebuyers. Resale activity also edged up in parts of the New York District, although prices continued to be depressed due to a substantial volume of foreclosures and short sales. New and existing home sales remained flat in the Philadelphia District, and home sales continued to decline throughout the St. Louis District. Sales of higher-priced homes were very slow, according to Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Kansas City. Moreover, real estate agents in the Boston and Cleveland Districts were uncertain about the future of home sales once the tax credit expires. Availability of financing continued to be a concern for potential buyers in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts. Residential construction activity remained weak in most Districts. Atlanta reported that construction remained very low, and Cleveland expected new home construction to proceed at a slow pace. Chicago indicated that construction on existing developments edged up, but St. Louis reported that construction activity declined. Kansas City reported that housing starts stabilized, although levels remained well below a year ago and were not expected to improve over the next three months. Philadelphia noted that builders continued to offer increased incentives to boost sales. Commercial real estate continued to weaken across the 12 Districts, although even this sector had scattered bright spots. Each District indicated that demand for private commercial real estate was weak, with New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco all characterizing activity as declining further since the last report. An inability to obtain credit was often cited as a problem for businesses that wanted to purchase or build space. High vacancy rates were noted as a key concern especially for landlords who were not offering concessions. And, while industrial real estate in the Richmond District was generally weak, renewed interest by retailers to revisit postponed expansion plans was also noted. Finally, public nonresidential construction activity funded by federal stimulus projects was a source of strength in the Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts, but gains were often offset by state and local government cutbacks. Banking and Financial Services Many Districts continued to report weak or declining loan demand, and many noted further erosion of credit quality. For example, demand was reported as stable or declining by New York, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Cleveland noted that commercial and industrial lending was soft and consumer lending was flat or reduced. In the Richmond District, modest signs of improvement in consumer loans were cited from banks in areas typically supported by the health care and education industries. Philadelphia also reported a small gain in consumer lending. San Francisco said that loan demand was ""largely stable or perhaps rose slightly."" A major exception to the general pattern of weak or declining lending activity was in residential real estate. Most Districts cited the federal government's first-time homebuyer program as supporting residential lending activity. However, Dallas reported that residential mortgage demand was disappointing, and St. Louis mentioned a moderate decline in real estate lending. Credit quality continued to be a problem, and rising delinquencies were often noted. For example, credit quality was described as stable or declining in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Kansas City Districts. Half of the contacts for Kansas City expected loan quality to continue to erode over the next six months. Cleveland stated that the quality of loan applicants had deteriorated somewhat, mostly on the business side. Delinquencies were also widely reported to be up; New York particularly noted rising delinquency rates among both consumer and commercial mortgage loans. Employment, Wages, and Prices Labor market conditions were generally reported as weak or mixed across Districts, but a few encouraging signs were noted. Employment activity was soft in the Kansas City District, and hiring remained limited in the Boston District. While a slowdown in layoffs was reported by Atlanta, no hiring was generally expected. Reports from Cleveland were mixed, but indicated declining employment in commercial construction and coal mining. Employment levels held steady in the Dallas District, with scattered reports of layoffs. However, staffing firms there noted improvement in contract and temporary employment. Minneapolis reported a weak labor market, but some signs of improvement were noted among auto-related industries. A major New York employment agency specializing in office workers reported renewed softening in recent weeks, with only scattered hiring at financial institutions and virtually no hiring in the legal and publishing industries. Richmond noted reports from temporary employment agencies were evenly mixed between reports of strengthening and weakening, but with increased optimism for the near term expressed since the last report. Wage and price pressures were generally described as subdued across most Districts. Wages were flat in the San Francisco District, but increased moderately in the Minneapolis District. In the Boston District, business services firms (mainly advertising and consulting) reported modest salary increases, but a decline in bonuses left total compensation slightly reduced. Wage pressures were characterized as ""not significant"" in the Chicago District and ""contained"" in the Cleveland District. Prices followed a similar pattern to wages, with reports of little significant pressure on either input or output prices, although moderate increases were observed for materials prices. For example, prices movements were characterized as generally subdued or little changed in the Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Minneapolis Districts. Cleveland noted stable construction materials prices, but added that the cost of steel had experienced an uptick. Materials prices in general were reported to be up in the Kansas City District. Boston said that selling prices of manufacturing goods were flat to slightly up, but noted that product competition and consumer clout was leading to downward pressures in some market segments. Retail price inflation slowed slightly in the Richmond District, while retail prices were stable in the Philadelphia District and edged down in the Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. Agriculture and Natural Resources Assessments of agricultural activity were mixed. Reports from Richmond and Minneapolis indicated that favorable growing conditions allowed farmers to make steady progress in harvesting summer crops and planting winter crops. In some parts of the Minneapolis District, however, a persistent drought delayed harvesting. In contrast, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas Districts all noted unusually high amounts of rainfall. In the Atlanta District, floods damaged some of North Georgia's nurseries, vegetable farms, and commercial vineyards, but benefited Florida citrus growers. Similarly, widespread rains brought much-needed relief to drought-stricken parts of the Dallas District, allowing many ranchers to scale back costly supplemental feeding--but not in time to prevent severe losses to livestock and crops. Chicago and St. Louis mentioned that wet weather had slowed crop maturity and harvesting, while Chicago reported lower than expected yields. Kansas City indicated that, despite some delayed harvests, farmers expected above-average yields.Activity in the energy industry remained weak. Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco reported increases in oil and gas inventories as demand continued to weaken. Atlanta indicated that refining margins continued to deteriorate, which led to delays in new projects. Cleveland noted that sharply lower contract prices for coal prompted coal miners to continue their deep cutbacks in production and to keep their capital spending on hold. Kansas City mentioned that overall drilling activity improved slightly, but that rig counts were still at historically low levels. Dallas remarked that rig counts rose in September and early October, spurred by oil drilling. However, Dallas also indicated that, despite the increase, excess capacity in the industry had resulted in job losses and weak domestic pricing. Minneapolis reported that activity in the energy and mining sectors increased slightly and noted that oil and gas exploration inched up in late September.",2009-10-21
62,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and based on information collected on or before November 20, 2009.  This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.  Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that economic conditions have generally improved modestly since the last report. Eight Districts indicated some pickup in activity or improvement in conditions, while the remaining four--Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and Atlanta--reported that conditions were little changed and/or mixed.  Consumer spending was reported to have picked up moderately since the last report, for both general merchandise and vehicles; a number of Districts noted relatively robust sales of used autos.  Most Districts indicated that non-auto retailers were holding lean inventories going into the holiday season.  Tourism activity varied across Districts.  Manufacturing conditions were said to be, on balance, steady to moderately improving across most of the country, while conditions in the nonfinancial service sector generally strengthened somewhat, though with some variation across Districts and across industries.  Residential real estate conditions were somewhat improved from very low levels, on balance, led by the lower end of the market.  Most Districts reported some pickup in home sales, though prices were generally said to be flat or declining modestly; residential construction was characterized as weak, but some Districts did note some pickup in activity.  Commercial real estate markets and construction activity were depicted as very weak and, in many cases, deteriorating.  Financial institutions generally reported steady to weaker loan demand, continued tight credit standards, and steady or deteriorating loan quality.  In the agricultural sector, the fall harvest was delayed in the eastern half of the nation due to excessively wet conditions during October and early November.  Most energy-producing Districts noted a slight uptick in activity in the sector since the last report. Labor market conditions remained weak since the last report, though there were signs of stabilization and scattered signs of improvement.  While some Districts reported upward pressure on commodity prices, they saw little or no indication of upward wage pressures or of any significant increase in prices of finished goods. Consumer Spending and Tourism Consumer spending strengthened since the last report, with sales of both general merchandise and autos improving across much of the country.  Non-auto sales were reported to have picked up in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts; sales were described as steady or mixed in the Boston, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts.  St. Louis described retail sales as below expectations and down from a year earlier.  Auto sales generally improved since the last report, in some cases rebounding from a brief dip after the ""cash-for-clunkers"" program ended.  Increased vehicle sales were reported from New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas, while sales were described as flat or mixed in the Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts.  A number of Districts reported that used vehicles have been selling better than new ones. Most Districts also noted that retailers were holding leaner inventories this holiday season, though some indicate that retailers have recently become more optimistic about the holiday-season outlook.  Auto dealers' inventories, largely depleted during the cash-for-clunkers program, have been or are being rebuilt. Tourism was mixed across those Districts reporting.  Travel and tourism--especially leisure travel--was described as robust or improved in the New York, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Atlanta and Kansas City characterized tourism as sluggish, while Richmond and Minneapolis described it as mixed; Richmond noted that tourism has been adversely affected by severe and damaging coastal storms, while Kansas City characterized the outlook as ""grim.""  New York indicated that business travel remained sluggish, but Minneapolis and Dallas note a slight pickup.  Nonfinancial Services Activity in the service sector generally picked up since the last report, though results were mixed across Districts and across service industries.  New York and Philadelphia reported that service-sector activity overall remained steady to up slightly, while St. Louis noted expanding activity.  The information technology industry was reported to be showing improvement in the Boston, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts.  A pickup in activity at staffing firms was reported by Boston and Dallas, whereas New York noted that activity remained sluggish.  Strength in health services was noted in the Boston and Richmond Districts.  Shipping activity was characterized as flat in the Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City District, while Dallas reports some gain; however, Dallas and Atlanta both noted particular weakness in rail shipping activity.  Professional and business support firms reportedly registered some improvement in the St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts but flat to declining activity in Richmond and San Francisco.   Manufacturing Most Districts reported mixed to moderately improving manufacturing conditions since the last report. New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco all noted modest increases in manufacturing activity within their Districts. Manufacturing conditions in the Boston and Dallas Districts were characterized as mixed, with some improvement noted for biopharmaceuticals companies in Boston and high-tech manufacturing firms in Dallas. By contrast, Richmond and Chicago both reported that manufacturing activity had leveled off since the last report, while activity continued to decline in the Atlanta and St. Louis Districts, although at a somewhat slower pace than the last report. Tighter credit limited the ability of customers to place new orders in the Richmond District, while in the Chicago District, contacts noted a slowdown in the restocking of inventories. Increases in activity related to the transportation industry were cited in the Chicago, St. Louis, Cleveland, and Kansas City Districts, although such activity was mixed in the Dallas District and reported as declining in the San Francisco District. Several Districts noted an uptick in food-related production.  Many Districts reported that their contacts were optimistic about the near-term outlook. Manufacturers in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts expected business conditions to improve in the coming months, while producers in the Cleveland District expressed uncertainty about near-term conditions. The outlook in the Dallas District was mixed, with most manufacturers expressing cautious optimism about the near term and construction-related manufacturers expressing pessimism about the future largely due to expectations of prolonged weakness in commercial real estate. Real Estate and Construction Home sales and construction activity improved across much of the nation, though prices were generally said to be flat or still declining somewhat.  A majority of Districts reported that the lower-priced segment of the housing market has outperformed the high end.  Increases in sales activity were reported in the Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, whereas sales were described as steady or mixed in the New York and Philadelphia Districts.  Multifamily housing markets deteriorated further in the New York and Chicago Districts.  More broadly, a number of eastern Districts reported continued declines in home prices--specifically, Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond.  In contrast, prices were said to have firmed somewhat in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts and stabilized in the Chicago and Kansas City Districts. Most reports maintained that the lower end of the market has outperformed the higher end: New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City all noted relative weakness at the high end of the market, with relative strength at the lower end; in most cases, this strength was largely attributed to the homebuyer tax credit (which was recently reinstated and expanded to include existing owners).  Despite the firming in sales, the level of new residential construction activity was generally characterized as weak, though recent trends have been mixed--Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas noted some pickup in home construction, whereas the Chicago and St. Louis Districts reported declines.  Residential construction was described as flat or stabilizing by Cleveland, Minneapolis, and San Francisco. Commercial real estate conditions were widely characterized as weak and, in many cases, deteriorating further.  Market conditions were reported to have weakened in virtually all Districts, with rising vacancy rates, downward pressure on rents, and little, if any, new development.  Expectations for 2010 were also quite low.  Boston characterized the commercial real estate outlook as ""bleak,"" Dallas noted that construction was at ""historically low levels,"" and Kansas City described the sector as ""distressed.""  Still, some Districts noted scattered signs of encouragement: Cleveland and Chicago referenced public-works projects as a source of increased business, Richmond noted signs of increased leasing activity from the health and education sectors, Atlanta indicated a modest pickup in new development projects, Minneapolis noted some recently started hotel and retail development, and San Francisco cited slight improvement in availability of financing for new development. Banking and Finance Banks reported steady to softer conditions in most Districts.  Loan demand was said to have weakened in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts.  New York noted particular weakness in demand for home mortgage loans, whereas Richmond and St. Louis reported this to be the strongest segment of late.  For the most part, the weakness appears to have been concentrated in the commercial sector, though Boston and Chicago reported some pickup in commercial real estate lending--largely refinancing.  Credit quality showed signs of deteriorating in the New York, Philadelphia, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts but was described as stable or mixed in Cleveland, Chicago, and Kansas City, with Chicago reporting some improvement outside of commercial real estate.  Increasingly tight credit standards were reported in the New York, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco--largely on commercial loans.  Agriculture and Natural Resources  Excessively wet conditions during October and early November were reported in a number of Districts. As a result, the fall harvest was delayed in many parts of the Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts. Flooding from Tropical Storm Ida and a November ""nor'easter"" damaged crops and delayed planting throughout the Richmond District, and Virginia health officials closed fishing in all Chesapeake Bay tributaries and temporarily banned the harvesting of shellfish due to potential storm water contamination. By contrast, rainfall in the Dallas District helped alleviate drought conditions experienced in many parts of the region. Contacts in the Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts noted that corn and soybean prices rallied over the past month, although a wide variation in margins was expected for crop farms due to differences in input costs. Losses for livestock operations occurred in the Chicago and Kansas City Districts.  Most energy-producing Districts reported a slight uptick in activity in extraction industries since the last report. Contacts in the Cleveland, Atlanta, Dallas, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts noted steady to increasing oil and natural gas production within their regions, albeit from low levels of production observed earlier this year. Contacts in the Cleveland District also reported that a sharp decline in coal production had leveled out since the last report. In general, oil prices increased somewhat, while reports on the price of natural gas were mixed due in large part to differences in inventory levels across Districts. Mining activity in the Minneapolis District increased. Employment, Wages, and Prices Labor market conditions remained weak since the last report, with further layoffs, sluggish hiring, and high levels of unemployment in most Districts. However, contacts in the Atlanta, Cleveland, and Richmond Districts reported that the pace of job cuts generally slowed in their regions, and most contacts in the Dallas District reported stable employment levels. Despite generally weak employment conditions, some signs of improvement were noted. For example, contacts in Boston reported that they were beginning to hire and reverse pay cuts or freezes that were implemented earlier in the year, and contacts in the St. Louis District reported that the service sector had started to expand recently. Expectations for the holiday season were mixed across Districts, with contacts in the New York and Dallas Districts reporting lighter-than-normal seasonal hiring and/or increases in the hours of existing employees, as opposed to hiring temporary workers, to meet the seasonal demand. On the other hand, most retailers in the Richmond District have hired the usual number of seasonal workers this year. Districts generally reported little or no upward wage pressures, while some Districts noted upward pressure in commodity prices, and most Districts reported stable selling prices. Wages were largely reported to be holding steady in the Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Most Districts reported stable prices overall, although some reported higher input prices, largely for energy and other commodities used in production, with a limited ability to raise selling prices. Prices were reported as moderately lower in the Kansas City District, and downward price pressures were cited for some professional services and intermodal transportation firms in the Dallas District. Some makers of food products and chemicals in the Philadelphia District reported raising prices, and the prices of computer memory chips continued to firm in the San Francisco District. Retailers in several Districts indicated that they have managed inventory levels in an effort to prevent the steep price discounting that occurred last year, however, some promotional price discounting is expected through the holiday season.",2009-12-02
63,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of  Philadelphia and based on information collected on or before January 4, 2010.  This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts  outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal  Reserve officials.  Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that while economic activity remains at a low level, conditions have improved modestly further, and those improvements are broader geographically than in the last report. Ten Districts reported some increased activity or improvement in conditions, while the remaining two--Philadelphia and Richmond--reported mixed conditions. The last Beige Book reported eight Districts with increased activity or improving conditions and four Districts showing little change and/or mixed conditions. Most Districts reported that consumer spending in the recent 2009 holiday season was slightly greater than in 2008, but still far below 2007 levels. Retail inventory levels remain very lean in nearly all Districts. Auto sales held steady or increased slightly since the last Beige Book in most Districts. Reports on tourism were mostly flat or weak, but for two Districts whose ski resorts enjoyed early season snowstorms. Nonfinancial services activity generally improved in Districts that reported on this sector. Of five Districts reporting transportation services, volumes were slightly up or mixed. Manufacturing activity has increased or held steady since the last report in most Districts. Among Districts reporting on near-term expectations, the manufacturing outlook was optimistic, but spending plans remain cautious. Toward the end of 2009, home sales increased in most Districts, especially for lower-priced homes. Home prices appeared to have changed little since the last Beige Book, and residential construction remained at low levels in most Districts. Commercial real estate was still weak in nearly all Districts with rising vacancy rates and falling rents. Since the last report, loan demand continued to decline or remained weak in most Districts, while credit quality continued to deteriorate. Cold weather at the end of the year adversely affected some late crops and stressed livestock, but above-average yields for early crops were reported by some Districts. Energy-related production has risen moderately since the last Beige Book. Although some hiring was reported in a few Federal Reserve Districts, labor market conditions remained generally weak with modest wage increases appearing in just a few Districts. Price pressures remained subdued in nearly all Districts, though increases in metals prices were reported and agricultural prices have been mixed. Consumer Spending and Tourism Consumer spending in the recent 2009 holiday season was modestly greater than in 2008 for eight Districts, although as retailers in the Philadelphia and San Francisco Districts noted, 2008 sales were so low compared with 2007, that the relatively small 2009 gains did not represent a significant shift in trend. Consumers were variously described as cautious, price sensitive, and focused on necessities, but sometimes willing to spend on discretionary purchases. Kansas City and New York reported holiday sales comparable to prior year sales, while Cleveland and Richmond reported weaker holiday sales in 2009 than in 2008. Entering the holiday period, retail inventories were maintained or lowered further to lean levels in the Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, and New York Districts. Some Chicago retailers reported running out of high-demand items during the holiday season, but inventory levels rose slightly in the Kansas City District. Auto sales were flat or up slightly for some dealers since the last Beige Book in the Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, and Philadelphia Districts. Dealer incentives boosted year-end inventory clearance according to Chicago District contacts. In the Dallas, Minneapolis, New York, and San Francisco Districts auto sales held steady or were mixed across states. The Kansas City and Richmond Districts reported lower auto sales since the last report. Some dealers in the Cleveland and New York Districts cited difficulties securing floor-plan financing. Difficulties securing customer financing was a concern cited by some Kansas City District dealers, while Philadelphia District dealers credited easier financing for supporting their recent sales. Early-season snowstorms gave ski resorts a big lift in the Richmond and Minneapolis Districts; otherwise travel and tourism reports were mostly flat or weak in these and other Districts. One Minnesota-based travel services firm shut down due to lack of demand, and Richmond's tourism contacts reported consumers searching for deeply discounted packages and dining out less despite special offers. The New York, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts also reported flat or weaker tourism. New York City's Broadway theaters reported weaker attendance this past holiday season than in 2008. Atlanta reported sluggish tourism throughout their District, but expected a boost from hosting upcoming National Football League events, and from strong 2010 cruise line bookings--a result of deep discounting. Kansas City and San Francisco noted sluggish business travel, placing downward pressure on airline passenger volumes, while Dallas reported airline demand recovering and fares stabilizing. The San Francisco District reported greater visitor volumes in Hawaii and Las Vegas, while occupancy rates in Seattle and Southern California were down. Nonfinancial Services Districts reporting on nonfinancial services generally indicated an upward trend in activity, although in some areas reports were mixed. Boston reported widespread positive activity in advertising, consulting, private equity firms, healthcare, biotechnology, education, and government services. High-tech service firms reported favorable conditions in Kansas City. New York reported a general pickup in activity. Health care providers reported increased demand in the San Francisco District, while professional services, especially advertising and accounting weakened. The Minneapolis District also reported mixed results across sectors, while activity in the Richmond District was generally down. Hiring through staffing firms was reported up in New York, Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas with office and health care workers in greatest demand. Direct firm hiring was reported up in the St. Louis District, flat in Dallas, flat to down in New York, and down in Richmond. Among the five Districts reporting on transportation services, activity was mostly up slightly, or mixed. Freight shipping volumes were up slightly in the Atlanta, Cleveland, and Dallas Districts, while Kansas City reported a slight slowdown in activity. The Richmond District's port activity gained from increased international trade, especially imports of high-end vehicles, but intermodal firms in the Dallas District reported that imports dropped and exports flattened producing no increase in cargo volumes. Dallas also reported continued declines in rail cargo volume. Manufacturing Manufacturing activity has improved since the last report in six Districts. New York reported a general pickup in activity, broad optimism, and some increase in employment. Production was stable or slightly up in the Cleveland District. Firms in the Cleveland District expect greater export opportunities going forward, but steel firms expect slow growth in overall demand. Manufacturers in the Chicago District cited gains at firms tied to the auto industry and those benefiting from an increase in exports to Asia. Firms in the Boston District also cited Asian exports as well as defense work as sources of their positive demand, but identified weak demand for exports to Europe and for products related to energy sectors and commercial construction. San Francisco reported a modest net improvement in manufacturing activity, with semiconductors strengthening and aircraft and parts stabilizing at moderate levels. Metal fabricators and housing products have also stabilized, but at very low levels. Three Districts reported mixed results for manufacturing. Food products, furniture, and chemical firms reported slight increases in the Philadelphia District while other manufacturing sectors continued to decline. Dallas reported strength in high-tech and corrugated packaging, seasonal increases in food producers, little change in fabricated metals and petrochemicals, seasonal decreases in aircraft components, and weaknesses in emergency vehicles and construction-related manufacturing. The Minneapolis District reported manufacturing activity up in Minnesota, but down in the Dakotas based on a recent survey of new orders. Manufacturing activity was weak in the other Districts. Richmond reported widespread weakness across shipments, new orders, and employment within its manufacturing sector and Atlanta saw orders and production drop back after an increase in November. The St. Louis District reported a continued decline in activity, persistent weakness in employment, and plant closings, on net. Manufacturers' expectations for the near future as reported from the Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, New York, and Philadelphia Districts were all optimistic, although Kansas City firms were less optimistic than the last report. Capital spending plans remained more cautious. Only Boston and Philadelphia reported that firms were planning to increase capital spending in the current year. Cleveland, Chicago, and Kansas City reported expectations of continued modest spending. Real Estate and Construction Homes sales increased toward the end of 2009 in most Federal Reserve Districts, except San Francisco, where demand for housing has been steady, and Kansas City, where residential real estate activity has eased since the last Beige Book. In New York, Richmond, and Atlanta, residential real estate activity was described as mixed across areas of the District. In the Atlanta District, existing home sales increased, but new home sales decreased. In all Districts, sales of lower-priced homes tended to increase proportionately more than sales of higher-priced homes, due at least in part to the first-time buyer federal tax credit, according to real estate contacts.  In several Districts real estate contacts reported that the original expiration date for the credit boosted sales in November and led to a more than usual slowdown in sales in December. However, some contacts noted that the extension of the credit into 2010 could give an added impetus to the expected seasonal sales upturn this spring. Residential construction activity remained at low levels in most Districts, although home building was reported to have increased in the Chicago and Minneapolis Districts. Home prices appeared to have changed little since the last Beige Book, overall. Boston, Philadelphia, and Cleveland reported declines in home prices since the last Beige Book. Richmond reported nearly steady prices. Dallas reported some firming in prices. Nonresidential real estate conditions remained soft in nearly all Districts. New York, Philadelphia, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported further weakening in demand for commercial and industrial space. Boston received mixed reports on sales and leasing activity from commercial real estate contacts in the District, and Minneapolis reported some increases in sales of commercial buildings. Richmond reported that sales of nonresidential properties remained slow, but that leasing of office and retail space has picked up. Vacancy rates were rising and rents were declining in most Districts. Several Districts reported that landlords were focused on tenant retention and that slack demand was allowing tenants to negotiate lease extensions at low rents and with favorable allowances. San Francisco reported that lower rents appeared to be supporting an upturn in leasing in some parts of that District, although vacancy rates continued to rise. Nonresidential construction activity was generally weak in all Districts, although St. Louis reported some gains in construction of education facilities and Cleveland reported a recent increase in nonresidential contracting. Banking and Finance Loan demand continued to decline or remained weak in most Districts. St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco noted general declines or soft loan demand.  New York reported declining demand for all types of loans except residential mortgages for which demand has been steady. Philadelphia reported continuing declines for all categories of credit. Cleveland noted declining demand for business loans and underutilization of commercial credit lines. Richmond reported that commercial and industrial loan demand was steady to slightly up since the last Beige Book but still down year-to-year. Chicago noted low utilization of commercial credit lines but an uptick in financing of mergers and acquisitions. Other recent increases were reported for mortgage refinancing in the Atlanta District and auto loans in the Chicago District. San Francisco noted a small improvement in venture capital financing and initial public offerings. A number of Districts reported that credit quality continued to deteriorate. Financial institutions in the New York District reported ongoing increases in delinquencies for all types of loans. Banks in the Philadelphia District reported that delinquencies and defaults continued to rise for all types of loans, although less sharply than at the time of the previous Beige Book. Cleveland received reports of steady consumer credit quality but high and rising commercial loan delinquencies. Kansas City noted year-over-year declines in credit quality among financial institutions in the District, and Dallas and San Francisco reported continued deterioration at financial institutions in their Districts. Agriculture and Natural Resources Federal Reserve District Banks reporting on agricultural conditions generally indicated that cold weather at the turn of the year had adversely affected crops and stressed livestock.  Atlanta noted damage to citrus crops from the cold, and Chicago and Minneapolis reported that winter storms halted corn harvesting, and impeded tillage and fertilizer application. However, Dallas reported that rain improved soil conditions after a dry period in that District. Corn and soybean crop yields before the onset of cold weather and storms were described as above average in the Chicago and Kansas City Districts. Kansas City also reported that the winter wheat crop was progressing normally. San Francisco reported an increase in sales of agricultural products, with a boost from a rise in demand from foreign countries. Agricultural prices have been mixed. Grain and soybean prices were mostly on the rise, according to reports from Chicago and Kansas City. Chicago also reported increased prices for milk and hogs, but a decline in cattle prices. Production of energy-related materials has risen moderately since the last Beige Book. Atlanta reported that oil production has continued to increase. Minneapolis reported an increase in oil and gas exploration, and Kansas City and Dallas reported increases in drilling. San Francisco noted an increase in extraction of natural gas but a continued low rate of oil extraction. In contrast to generally rising oil and gas production, coal production was reported to have declined by Cleveland and St. Louis, and falling iron mining activity was reported by Minneapolis. Employment, Wages, and Prices Labor market conditions remained soft in most Federal Reserve Districts, although New York reported a modest pickup in hiring and St. Louis reported that several service-sector firms in that District recently announced plans to hire new workers. In the Richmond District, temporary employment agencies gave mixed reports, but some noted increased demand for administrative and sales workers, laborers, and warehousing and distribution workers. Wage pressures remained subdued in most Federal Reserve Districts, and Atlanta noted continued wage freezes at some employers in that District. However, Boston reported some modest pay increases, and Minneapolis indicated that wages in that District have been level or rising moderately. Price pressures remained subdued in nearly all Federal Reserve Districts, although increases in metals prices were noted in Boston, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco. Raw materials prices, other than metals, were reported to be mostly steady, although firms in the New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago Districts noted some increases in the cost of the inputs they use. Agricultural commodity prices were reported on the increase by Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas. Most Districts reported that retail prices have been steady.",2010-01-13
64,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and based on information collected on or before February 22, 2010.  This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.  Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that economic conditions continued to expand since the last report, although severe snowstorms in early February held back activity in several Districts.  Nine Districts reported that economic activity improved, but in most cases the increases were modest.  Overall conditions were described as mixed in the Atlanta and St. Louis Districts, though St. Louis noted further signs of improvement in some areas.  Richmond reported that economic activity slackened or remained soft across most sectors, due importantly to especially severe February weather in that region. Consumer spending improved slightly in many Districts since the last survey, but severe snowstorms in early February limited activity in some Districts.  Tourist activity was reported as increased or mixed, with some improvement in hotel occupancies.  The demand for services was generally positive across Districts, most notably for health-care and information technology firms.  Of the five Districts reporting on transportation, three characterized activity as improved over the previous survey.  Manufacturing activity strengthened in most regions, particularly in the high-tech equipment, automobile, and metal industries.  Residential real estate markets improved in a number of Districts, although several Districts noted that activity softened or remained weak partly due to extreme winter weather.  Most Districts characterized commercial real estate and construction activity as weak or having declined further, but some Districts noted slight stabilization and a few signs of modest improvement.  Loan demand remained weak, and lending standards remained tight across the country.  Harsh weather continued to negatively affect agricultural activity, although some Districts reported favorable crop conditions.  Districts reporting on energy activity said it continued to strengthen, particularly drilling for natural gas.  Price pressures were mostly limited, with the exception of some increases in raw materials prices.  Even with input costs rising, selling prices remained stable due to competitive pressures and limited pricing power. Although some Districts reported an uptick in hiring or a slowdown in layoffs, labor markets generally remained soft throughout the nation, which resulted in minimal wage pressures. Consumer Spending and Tourism Consumer spending showed signs of improvement in many Districts since the last report but was hampered in several regions by severe weather conditions in early February.  Retail sales improved in the Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, and New York said sales were well above year-ago levels in January and met expectations in February despite inclement weather.  Philadelphia also reported that sales were moving up slowly until snowstorms hit in February.  Boston and Cleveland characterized sales as mixed but slightly higher overall than year ago levels.  Sales were lower than expected in the Atlanta and Kansas City Districts and were down from year-ago levels in the St. Louis District.  Several Districts reported that sales were strongest for lower-priced items, while sales of luxury and big ticket items remained sluggish.  However, San Francisco noted scattered reports of increased discretionary spending, and Cleveland said some retailers noted a broader, if still slight, increase in demand across a variety of products.  Inventories were being managed carefully and held at fairly low levels in most Districts, but Chicago said rising sales were leading retailers to begin rebuilding inventories from low levels. Auto sales were generally reported as flat or down, with a few Districts again noting that some of the sluggishness was likely due to poor weather conditions.  New York, Cleveland, and San Francisco all noted some softening in new auto sales, though New York cited brisk sales of used vehicles.  Chicago and Kansas City also reported declining auto sales, while Dallas noted some seasonal softness and Atlanta said sales remained weak.  Some Districts reported modest improvement in auto credit conditions.  Cleveland noted that many consumers remain reliant on manufacturers' incentives, and auto dealers in the Chicago District blamed part of their recent sales decline on reduced factory incentives. Districts reporting on tourism said that activity was either rising or mixed since the last survey period.  Ski resorts in the Richmond and Kansas City Districts reported at least modest rebounds in activity from year-ago levels, while Minneapolis characterized skier visits to a Montana resort as flat.  New York said hotel occupancies in Manhattan were up considerably from a year ago in January and Broadway theatre activity was robust before falling off due to weather in February.  Atlanta also reported rising tourism activity related to several successful major sporting events and a well-attended Mardi Gras in New Orleans.  San Francisco noted increases in visitors to Hawaii and Las Vegas and said hotel occupancies stabilized in some other areas. Nonfinancial Services Nonfinancial services activity was reported as steady or improved by the majority of Districts.  Boston, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco reported generally solid demand in health-care services, although Minneapolis noted continued weakness in elective procedures.   New York indicated that a growing number of service firms planned to increase capital spending in the months ahead, but investment expectations diminished among high-tech companies in the Kansas City District.  Richmond reported that service revenues fell due to the record snowstorms, but a few contacts saw a slight pickup in demand, particularly architectural firms, hospitals, and financial service professionals. In transportation services, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City reported an improvement in activity since the last survey, while Dallas said activity was mixed and St. Louis noted large job cuts in the industry.  Regional rail loadings were above year-ago levels in the Atlanta District, especially for autos, chemicals, metals, and some construction-related equipment.  Intermodal firms in the Dallas District reported no change in cargo volumes, with a rise in exports being offset by a decline in imports.  Although shipping volumes increased, Cleveland noted that margins remained depressed due to over-capacity issues, limiting investment in new trucks. Manufacturing  Manufacturing activity increased further in most Districts, although Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco characterized overall activity as flat or mixed.  Philadelphia reported widespread production increases across most industries, and manufacturers in the Cleveland District reported a general rise in capacity utilization.  Many Districts reported strong production in metals, and the Boston, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts noted strength in high-tech equipment, particularly semiconductors.  Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas noted solid improvements in auto-related manufacturing.  A consumer goods company in the Boston District said European sales were at healthier levels.  Contacts in the Chicago District reported strong growth in Asian exports but remained concerned about China's underlying economic strength.  Dallas reported that exports for natural-gas based products remained strong, but weak demand for refined products has trimmed margins and cut capacity utilization further.  Construction-related activity remained weak in the Chicago and Dallas Districts, and new orders for commercial aircraft and parts were sluggish in the San Francisco District.  Philadelphia and Richmond noted productions delays due to the winter snowstorms in February, but some factories were able to make up the losses with longer work hours and extended shifts.  Several manufacturers in the Philadelphia District said production gains could be limited due to continued tightening in credit markets and adverse developments in taxes and regulations.  Plant managers in a few Districts reported that a large number of customers were simply restocking inventories, leading to concerns about the sustainability of the increase.  However, contacts in most Districts remained optimistic for future months, with several reports of planned increases in capital spending. Real Estate and Construction Residential real estate markets improved in a number of Districts, remained weak or softened further in the New York, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts, was little changed in the San Francisco District, and characterized as mixed in the St. Louis District.  Richmond also reported overall housing activity as mixed, but one contact noted that absent the harsh weather, market conditions might have improved.  Adverse weather conditions also hampered home sales and construction in the New York, Philadelphia, and Atlanta Districts.  Most Districts attributed stronger home sales to the home-buyer tax credit, with several contacts apprehensive about future sales once the credit expires on April 30.  Philadelphia, Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas reported that sales were strongest for low-priced and starter homes, while Dallas cited financing difficulties for high-end homes.  Home construction was down or stagnant in most Districts, with the exception of the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts.  Atlanta said the most pronounced weakness was among Georgia homebuilders, and San Francisco attributed weak construction activity to elevated home inventory levels.  Home prices mostly remained flat or declined slightly, but signs of improvement were noted in the Boston and San Francisco Districts.  A real estate agent in a relatively upscale area of the New York District said prices have continued to drift downward but that short sales were relatively rare and most transactions were still above the mortgage balance. Commercial real estate conditions remained weak or declined further in most Districts, although some Districts noted slight stabilization or modest signs of improvement.  Commercial real estate activity weakened in the Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, though Dallas noted that leasing fell at a slower rate and San Francisco cited increased leasing in some segments.  Boston and Philadelphia said conditions remain weak, but both noted some improvement in sales of commercial space.  New York reported softer activity in the New York City area but some steadying in vacancies and rents elsewhere, while St. Louis said activity remained weak throughout the District.  Several Districts also noted that many tenants were pushing for, and in some cases receiving, concessions on rents.  All Districts reporting on commercial construction said that activity remained weak or slow, except for some moderate boost from federal stimulus projects and other public construction.  Credit for commercial development and transactions was still very difficult to obtain in several Districts, though San Francisco noted a slight improvement in financing availability. Banking and Finance Loan demand remained weak across the country.  New York, Cleveland, and Kansas City reported decreased demand for most types of loans.  Other Districts said loan demand was unchanged but soft.  Richmond and Chicago noted that the weak economic outlook was holding back loan demand, and San Francisco said caution about hiring and spending plans was keeping businesses from seeking credit.  However, Philadelphia and Richmond reported banks were receiving more inquiries from businesses about loans, and Dallas said contacts were hopeful that loan demand would pick up by the end of the year. Most Districts indicated that banks remained cautious about lending.  New York, St. Louis, and Kansas City reported somewhat tighter credit standards on commercial real estate loans, and New York noted tighter standards for commercial and industrial loans.  In other Districts, credit standards were little changed but remained tight.  Atlanta reported that banks had ample liquidity but were reluctant to reduce cash reserves.  Chicago said a leveling in asset quality was causing large banks to become more interested in lending to prime borrowers, but strained balance sheets were holding back lending by mid-size banks.  In the Dallas District, smaller banks reported that regulatory requirements were limiting their ability to expand real estate lending.  Loan quality remained a concern but showed signs of stabilizing in some Districts.  New York, Dallas, and San Francisco cited further declines in loan quality.  In addition, banks in the Philadelphia and Kansas City Districts were reported to be slightly less pessimistic about future loan quality than in the previous survey. Agriculture and Natural Resources Harsh winter weather continued to dampen overall agricultural activity, although crop conditions were still generally favorable in most Districts.  Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas reported that livestock were stressed by severe weather and that producers provided supplemental feed due to poor grazing conditions.  Atlanta commented that cold temperatures caused minor freeze damage to vegetable and citrus crops.  Despite below-average temperatures, Kansas City reported the winter wheat crop was in generally good condition.  Dallas and San Francisco said that heavy rains and snowfall improved soil moisture for this year's crop production, though some contacts were concerned that spring planting could be delayed if fields remain too wet.  Crop prices edged down following the bumper fall harvest, but Chicago noted that high-quality grain was selling at a premium, due in part to strong export demand.  Hog and cattle prices strengthened and dairy prices were flat.  Kansas City noted stronger farm incomes from crop production, while agricultural lenders in the Minneapolis District expected farm income and spending to decrease. Energy activity generally strengthened since the last survey period.  Kansas City and Dallas reported increased drilling activity, especially for natural gas, and Cleveland noted increased natural gas-related investment.  However, producers in the Kansas City District were concerned that a boost in supply from shale gas production could lower natural gas prices later in the year.  Minneapolis reported that oil exploration expanded in February, while oil production was stable in the Atlanta and San Francisco Districts.  Coal production in the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts remained below year-ago levels.  Minneapolis reported brisk activity in metal mining and continued energy construction. Employment, Wages, and Prices The pace of layoffs slowed in most Districts, but hiring plans still remained generally soft.  New York cited a slowdown in layoffs at a securities firm and noted a pickup in hiring in what was still characterized as an exceptionally weak legal industry.  Staffing firms in the Boston District also saw a strengthening in demand, particularly from the financial and manufacturing sectors.  Several manufacturing and construction firms in the Cleveland District began recalling workers, and temporary staffing accelerated in the Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts.  However, Chicago said demand for permanent workers was low, and a manufacturing contact in the Richmond District held back employment due to productivity improvements.  Layoffs were also reported at several retail and manufacturing firms in the Dallas District, and Minneapolis said companies in the medical insurance and financial services industries reduced employment.  Wage pressures were minimal, but Boston and Cleveland noted a lift in salary freezes and Richmond said wages rose at service and retail businesses. The majority of Districts reported limited price pressures, although several noted rising input costs due to higher commodities prices.  Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas noted an increase in metals prices, particularly steel, and Chicago and Kansas City said the upward pressure on some raw materials prices was likely to continue.  Lumber prices rose in the Cleveland and Richmond Districts due in large part to weather-related supply issues.  On the other hand, San Francisco reported commodity prices were stable or down, with declines in natural gas, copper, and aluminum prices.  Some contacts in the Boston District said customers sought fewer price concessions from vendors in order to better ensure reliable deliveries.  But nearly all Districts reported limited pricing power, with many firms unable to increase selling prices due to competitive pressure.  Retail prices were stable in most Districts, although San Francisco noted heavy discounting.  Districts generally expected stable prices overall heading forward.",2010-03-03
65,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and based on information collected before April 5, 2010. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.   Overall economic activity increased somewhat since the last report across all Federal Reserve Districts except St. Louis, which reported ""softened"" economic conditions. Districts generally reported increases in retail sales and vehicle sales. Tourism spending was up in a number of Districts. Reports on the services sector were generally mixed. Manufacturing activity increased in all Districts except St. Louis, and new orders were up. Many Districts reported increased activity in housing markets from low levels. Commercial real estate market activity remained very weak in most Districts. Activity in the banking and finance sector was mixed in a number of Districts, as loan volumes and credit quality decreased. Agricultural conditions were mixed as well, with positive conditions reported in Districts from the central and western parts of the country, while negative conditions were reported in the mid and southern Atlantic Districts. Mining and energy production and exploration increased for metals, oil and wind. While labor markets generally remained weak, some hiring activity was evident, particularly for temporary staff. Wage pressures were characterized as minimal or contained. Retail prices generally remained level, but some input prices increased. Consumer Spending and Tourism  District reports indicated that consumer spending increased during the reporting period. New York and Cleveland reported that recent sales strengthened, while sales rebounded in Richmond and Kansas City. Slight sales gains were reported in Philadelphia. Retail sales in San Francisco continued to improve, but remained somewhat sluggish on net. In St. Louis several new establishments opened, particularly in the food industry. Several Districts described consumers as somewhat more confident. Businesses were cautiously optimistic regarding future sales: Cleveland, Atlanta, Kansas City and Dallas noted that retailers expect sales to improve during the upcoming months. Sales of home furnishings and electronic goods increased in a number of Districts, while seasonal apparel sales were up in New York, Philadelphia and Kansas City. New York and Minneapolis noted that shopping by Canadians was strong at businesses near the border. Atlanta reported that retailers continued to keep inventory levels lower than normal, and retailers in New York reported that inventories are in very good shape. Vehicle sales improved in a number of Districts during March. New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco noted that auto sales picked up in recent weeks. Cleveland described sales as decent, while sales were steady in Kansas City and mixed in Richmond. Several Districts noted that favorable pricing and credit terms helped lure buyers into showrooms. Dealers in Philadelphia indicated that they expect sales to increase during the next few months. Tourism conditions also improved during the reporting period. New York, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco pointed to signs of increased tourism activity. Tourism was described as stable in most parts of the Atlanta District. Hotel occupancy rates were rising in New York, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Reports on room rates were mixed: New York and Kansas City noted increases, while Chicago reported rate cuts, particularly at luxury hotels. Managers at mountain resorts in the Richmond District reported that this winter was one of their best ski seasons ever. However, Atlanta noted that corporate bookings remained at very low levels at some high-end resorts. Nonfinancial Services Business services were mixed, with some signs of economic recovery. Boston and Minneapolis reported increased activity. Richmond and Dallas were mixed, while San Francisco said demand remained lackluster. St. Louis reported that the sector continued to decline. Advertising and consulting firms in Boston said demand is up substantially from the first quarter of 2009, while an advertising contact in Richmond and professional media services firms in San Francisco characterized sales as flat at low levels. Dallas reported sluggish demand for nontax-related accounting and legal services. Law firms in Minneapolis specializing in debt collections and bankruptcy saw strong demand, while a Richmond property manager noted a large number of repossessions. Manufacturing  Manufacturing activity increased since the last report across most of the country, with all Districts other than St. Louis reporting increases in orders, shipments, or production. Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco reported positive results in metals and fabrication. Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta and Chicago reported increased auto or auto component production. Boston, Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco saw increased production in electronic, computers or high-technology goods.  Chicago and Minneapolis saw increased production of energy-related products. However, for construction-related goods, Chicago and Dallas reported mixed conditions, Boston reported flat activity and St. Louis reported decreases. Overall, St. Louis saw more plant closures than plant openings. Banking and Finance  Bank lending activity was mixed by category in most Districts. Atlanta, St. Louis and Kansas City saw weaker loan demand across categories, while activity in San Francisco was flat at low levels and Dallas said that demand appears to be stabilizing. Demand for consumer credit decreased in New York and increased slightly in Philadelphia. Most banks in Cleveland reported weak consumer loan demand, although a few contacts saw a slight increase due to seasonal factors. Business and industrial loan volumes decreased in Philadelphia, Cleveland and Chicago and were flat in New York. San Francisco noted continued modest gains in venture capital funding. Credit standards remained generally unchanged across the nation, while credit quality was mixed. New York, Cleveland and Kansas City reported tighter lending standards for commercial mortgages. In Atlanta several business contacts reported difficulty getting credit. Dallas and San Francisco said standards continued to be tight. New York saw increased delinquency rates for all categories except consumer loans, which were flat. Philadelphia and Richmond saw little change in credit quality, while Cleveland was mixed. Dallas reported that credit quality was either stabilizing or improving, and appeared to have turned a corner. Chicago noted an improvement in consumer and business loan quality, although credit quality for many small firms continued to decline. Real Estate and Construction  Residential real estate activity increased, albeit from low levels, in most Districts, with the exceptions of St. Louis, where it was mixed, and San Francisco, where it was flat. Contacts in Philadelphia, Cleveland and Kansas City expressed concern about whether sales would continue to grow after the expiration of the first-time home buyer tax credit. New York, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco noted sluggish sales for high-end homes. Home prices were stable across most Districts, but decreased in parts of the New York and Atlanta Districts. Residential construction activity increased slightly in New York, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis and Dallas, but remained weak in Cleveland, Chicago and San Francisco. Commercial real estate activity was slow across the nation. Notable exceptions were Richmond, which saw an uptick in commercial leasing, and Dallas, where the sector was mixed and might be nearing bottom. In Boston, leasing activity consists largely of renewals, with many renewing tenants leasing less space. Manhattan Class A office rents were down 20 percent to 25 percent year over year. Contacts in Philadelphia, Richmond, Kansas City and Dallas expressed concern that lease concessions from landlords were putting downward pressure on rents. Commercial construction continued to be weak in most Districts. Cleveland saw some development in the energy and industrial segments. Agriculture and Natural Resources  Districts reported mixed results in agriculture. Atlanta reported that cold weather negatively affected crop conditions. Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas noted that wet conditions delayed planting, though Dallas also commented that current soil moisture levels will be beneficial for the growing season. Chicago expected a normal planting schedule. Minneapolis and San Francisco indicated favorable weather conditions. The calving season is doing well in the Minneapolis District, but Chicago and Minneapolis noted softening dairy output prices. Activity in the energy and mining sectors increased since the last report. Philadelphia, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco saw increases in oil exploration. Coal production was mixed in the Philadelphia District and increased in the Kansas City District. In the Minneapolis District, more wind energy projects are planned, and mining activity increased. Employment, Wages, and Prices  While overall labor markets remained weak, some hiring activity was evident, particularly for temporary staff. Employment in the manufacturing and services sectors in Boston remained relatively unchanged, while very little hiring occurred at major legal and financial firms in New York. In the Richmond District, job cuts subsided at retail businesses, and employment was stable at most other services firms. In Kansas City overall employment levels held steady, but more manufacturers and several energy-related firms planned to increase payrolls. Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago reported strong demand for temporary workers. A pickup in employment was noted in the manufacturing sector by Cleveland, with little change in staffing for retail, energy, transportation and banking. Atlanta noted that many businesses continued to increase hours worked for existing staff. Minneapolis reported that while labor markets remained weak, some signs of hiring were noted. Wage pressures were characterized as minimal or contained. In Boston, most firms reported instituting or planning to institute modest wage increases of 2 percent to 3 percent in 2010, while performance bonuses in the services sector were generally down. Richmond reported that average wages edged higher in March in the services sector, but declined slightly in manufacturing. Most companies hiring new workers in the Kansas City District were not offering higher salaries to attract qualified applicants. Dallas reported that just a handful of firms were planning on partially reinstating employer matches to retirement plans or giving small pay increases. In Chicago wage pressures were minimal; however, an increase in health-care costs was noted. San Francisco also reported significant increases in the costs of employee benefits, such as health insurance and pensions. Retail prices generally remained level, but some input prices increased. Where producers faced cost pressures on inputs, they were largely unable to pass those prices downstream to selling prices, although in Kansas City some manufacturers were considering raising selling prices due to higher raw materials costs. In Boston retail vendor and selling prices were stable. Philadelphia reported that prices of most goods and services have been steady, although there were increased reports of rising prices for basic materials and construction-related products. Apart from rising prices for steel and petroleum-based products in Cleveland, raw materials and product pricing were generally stable. Richmond noted moderate price increases in the manufacturing and services sectors. Chicago reported upward pressure on prices for plywood, industrial metals and petroleum-based fuels. In the Dallas District prices of chemicals and related products rose sharply, primarily due to plant outages. Natural gas prices slipped during the reporting period because of continued high levels of production, low industrial demand and the end of the winter season. Richmond and San Francisco reported increased overseas shipping costs.",2010-04-14
66,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and based on information collected on or before May 28, 2010. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.  Economic activity continued to improve since the last report across all twelve Federal Reserve Districts, although many Districts described the pace of growth as ""modest."" Consumer spending and tourism activity generally increased. Business spending also rose, on net, with employment and capital spending edging up but inventory investment slowing. By sector, nonfinancial services, manufacturing, and transportation continued to gradually improve. Residential real estate activity in many Districts was buoyed by the April deadline for the homebuyer tax credit. Commercial real estate remained weak, although some Districts reported an increase in leasing. Financial activity was little changed on balance, although a few Districts noted a modest increase in lending. Spring planting was generally ahead of the normal pace, while conditions in the natural resource sectors varied across the Districts. Prices of final goods and services were largely stable as higher input costs were not being passed along to customers and wage pressures continued to be minimal. Consumer Spending and TourismConsumer spending improved from the previous report. Spending continued to be concentrated in necessities as opposed to discretionary big-ticket items. Retail sales increased in April and May, although several Districts noted that the gains were uneven across months. Sales of spring and summer apparel were strong in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Sales of home improvement and lawn and garden equipment were reported to have strengthened in the Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts. Modest improvement in sales of discretionary home goods was noted by Cleveland, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Vehicle sales also rose, but the rate of increase reportedly slowed in May in the New York, Cleveland, and San Francisco Districts. Tourism activity improved. Dallas reported a continued increase in leisure air travel. Hotel occupancy rates rose in the New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, and convention activity increased in Atlanta and San Francisco. Richmond reported resort bookings for the Memorial Day holiday weekend were stronger than last year, and Atlanta indicated cruise-line bookings were up slightly. Atlanta also reported, however, that the Gulf oil spill and Tennessee floods had already resulted in some vacation lodging cancellations. The potential exists for a much greater impact, although contacts are quite uncertain as to the ultimate effects.   Business SpendingBusiness spending increased moderately from the previous report. Cleveland, Chicago and Dallas noted that growth in manufacturers' inventories was leveling off, while Boston, Atlanta, and St. Louis reported the same for retailers' inventories. In contrast, several Districts reported that auto production was failing to keep up with demand, pressuring already lean auto dealer stocks. Capital spending was slightly higher in a number of Districts, although several indicated that continuing caution on the part of firms and tight credit availability were limiting expenditures. The manufacturing, transportation, and energy industries accounted for most of the increase in spending on plant and equipment. Boston reported that spending on information technology services increased.   Nonfinancial ServicesNonfinancial service activity was slightly improved, on balance, from the previous report. Several Districts highlighted some strength in demand for professional technical services, such as software and information technology, engineering, and other scientific trades. In contrast, sluggishness remained in accounting, legal, marketing, media, and construction services. Demand for business support services was more mixed. Philadelphia and Chicago reported slightly higher demand while Boston and St. Louis noted that demand remained weak. St. Louis also indicated that budget cuts had led to reduced government and education services.    Manufacturing and Transportation  Manufacturing and transportation activity continued to gradually improve across all twelve Districts. Most Districts reported further increases in factory production, shipments, and new orders, although Philadelphia and Chicago noted that the pace of gains had slowed in May. Steel producers and metals manufacturers reported moderately higher production in Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas, although Chicago indicated capacity utilization leveled off in May. Auto and parts production increased in the Cleveland, Richmond, and Chicago Districts. Oil refinery capacity utilization was up in the Dallas District. Higher residential construction increased demand for construction equipment and materials in the Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Chicago also noted that demand from Asia and South America for heavy equipment continued to be robust. The output of medical equipment and pharmaceuticals remained strong in Boston and Chicago, as did high-tech manufacturing in Boston, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Food processing increased in Dallas and San Francisco. Trucking and rail activity increased, with freight traffic and raw material shipments on the rise in Cleveland, Atlanta, and Dallas.   Real Estate and ConstructionResidential real estate activity improved since the last report. Most Districts noted an increase in home sales and construction prior to the April 30th deadline for the homebuyer tax credit, with contacts in many of these Districts also indicating a corresponding slowing in activity in May. Tight credit, the elevated inventory of homes available for sale, and the ""shadow inventory"" of foreclosed properties on banks' balance sheets held back residential development in the New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts. Commercial real estate activity generally remained weak. Office, industrial, and retail vacancy rates continued to drift upward in many Districts putting downward pressure on rents. However, lower rents were said to have led to an increase in leasing activity in New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. The elevated inventory of existing properties for sale or rent continued to weigh on new private nonresidential construction. However, stronger industrial demand was noted in several Districts. Public construction increased in Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago, but slowed in Minneapolis.   Banking and FinanceFinancial activity was little changed on balance from the previous report. Commercial and industrial lending by banks remained weak in most Districts, although Philadelphia, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco noted business loan demand was firming. Philadelphia also indicated an increase in business lending by non-depository financial companies, and New York reported that underwriting and investment banking activity strengthened. Consumer lending weakened in most Districts. In contrast, real estate lending increased even though standards on these loans remained tighter than on other loans, particularly for commercial mortgages. Chicago noted that the secondary market for residential mortgages was beginning to improve, and private equity investment in commercial properties increased in Boston, Chicago, and Dallas. Loan quality was indicated to be stabilizing or gradually improving in most Districts, but remained an issue for banks with large exposures to real estate. Contacts in some Districts cited concerns over the potential impact of the European fiscal crisis on financial and business conditions, and reported a corresponding increase in uncertainty and financial market volatility.    Agriculture and Natural ResourcesCrop planting was generally ahead of the seasonal norm, particularly in the Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts, although soybean planting was lagging in St. Louis and Kansas City. Crop emergence was also ahead of the typical pace. Precipitation conditions were generally positive, with the exception of flooding in Tennessee and dryness in parts of the Richmond and Dallas Districts. Prices for hogs, cattle, and cotton were higher, while prices for grains, soybeans, and milk were roughly unchanged. Mining and energy industry activity varied across Districts. According to contacts in the Atlanta District, the Gulf oil spill had little immediate effect on oil production, although it had damaged fishing operations. Employment, Wages, and PricesLabor market conditions improved slightly with permanent employment levels edging up in most Districts. In addition, many Districts again noted an increase in temporary hires, with Boston and Dallas also indicating a pick up in temporary-to-permanent transitions. By industry, manufacturing was the most often cited source of employment gains (both temporary and permanent), and Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Dallas noted an increase in the manufacturing workweek. Other sources of increased employment were the biopharmaceutical industry in Boston, retail trade in Chicago, and transportation in Dallas.   Wage pressures were limited, although San Francisco noted upward pressure on employee benefit costs. Prices of final goods and services were largely unchanged in most Districts as higher input costs were not being passed along to customers and wage pressures continued to be minimal. Steel prices in many Districts moved higher, as did lumber and food prices, while energy prices generally declined. Several Districts noted tighter commodity supply conditions, with Richmond and Kansas City indicating an increase in supplier lead times and Boston and Atlanta reporting supply chain capacity constraints. Transportation costs moved up in the Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts, but diesel fuel cost pressures eased in New York.",2010-06-09
67,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and based on information collected on or before July 19, 2010. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.   Economic activity has continued to increase, on balance, since the previous survey, although the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts reported that the level of economic activity generally held steady.  Among those Districts reporting improvements in economic activity, a number of them noted that the increases were modest, and two Districts, Atlanta and Chicago, said that the pace of economic activity had slowed recently. Manufacturing activity continued to expand in most Districts, although several Districts reported that activity had slowed or leveled off during the reporting period.  Districts also noted improved conditions in the services sector.  The five Districts reporting on transportation noted increased activity.  Tourism activity also increased across the Districts, although the Atlanta District noted concerns about decreased leisure travel to the Gulf Coast.  Retail sales reports generally indicated a continued rise in spending, and several Districts noted that necessities continued to be strong sellers, while big-ticket items moved more slowly.  However, most Districts that reported on auto sales noted declines in recent weeks.  Activity in residential real estate markets was sluggish in most Districts after the expiration of the April 30 deadline for the homebuyer tax credit.  Commercial real estate markets, especially construction, remained weak.  Banking conditions varied across the Districts, with some Districts noting soft or decreased overall loan demand; credit standards remained tight in most reporting Districts.  Recent rains had mixed effects on crop conditions, while activity in the natural resources sector increased.  Overall labor market conditions improved modestly across the Districts, with several reports of temporary hiring.  Consumer prices of goods and services held steady in most reporting Districts. Input prices also held largely steady, with only a few reports of cost increases.  Wage pressures continued to be contained on the whole. Manufacturing and Other Business Activity Manufacturing activity in most Districts continued to move up since the last report, although the pace of activity slowed or activity leveled off in the New York, Cleveland, Kansas City, Chicago, Atlanta, and Richmond Districts.  Automobile manufacturing was a bright spot for the Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts.  Automobile parts suppliers also experienced increased demand in both the Richmond and Chicago Districts.  Fuel demand at refineries in the San Francisco District improved, while gasoline demand was steady in the Dallas District.  Firms in the semiconductor manufacturing industry reported relatively strong sales or demand growth in both the Boston and San Francisco Districts.  Firms in aircraft and parts manufacturing saw sales pick up in both the San Francisco and Dallas Districts.  Manufacturing firms in the Boston, Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts were optimistic that demand would continue to improve in the following months.  However, Cleveland's contacts expect demand growth to taper off, Philadelphia noted that the balance of positive over negative views had narrowed, and Atlanta reported fewer firms planning expansions in production.  Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas reported that firms in construction-related manufacturing experienced weak demand; construction supplies sales were flat in Kansas City, and Minneapolis reported that a firm in the sector was increasing production.  Steel production declined in both the Chicago and Cleveland Districts.  Some manufacturers in the Atlanta and San Francisco Districts reported high excess production capacity.  Capacity utilization was below pre-recession levels in Cleveland and edged lower among steel producers in Chicago. Activity in the services sector improved across most Districts since the previous report.  The freight transportation industry experienced gains in the Cleveland, Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, and Philadelphia Districts.  Boston, Minneapolis, and Dallas reported a pickup in demand for some consulting firms.  Tourism activity increased in the San Francisco, New York, Minneapolis, Richmond, Kansas City, and Atlanta Districts.  Atlanta reported that leisure travel decreased in the Gulf Coast, but some of the lost tourist traffic was offset by the presence of cleanup crews, oil company workers, and the National Guard.  Information technology firms saw increased business in the Philadelphia, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts, while activity was flat in the Minneapolis District.  Demand for healthcare services was flat in both the San Francisco and Richmond Districts, while activity increased in the Boston District. Consumer Spending Reports on retail sales during the early summer months were generally positive, although in most Districts the increases were modest.  Retail sales in the New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts were higher than year-earlier sales, and Dallas reported solid gains.  But sales in the Boston District were mixed compared with the previous year.  Recent sales increased slightly in the Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts; sales in the Richmond District weakened; and sales in the Kansas City District were flat compared with the previous report.  Several Districts cited apparel, food, and other necessities as recent strong sellers, while big-ticket items were weak sellers.  Contacts reported satisfactory inventory levels in the New York District, mixed inventory levels in the Boston District, and low or declining inventory levels in the Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts.  The outlook for sales was mixed:  Retailers in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts reported that they expect modest positive sales growth in the upcoming months; contacts in the Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts reported a less optimistic outlook going forward than in the previous report; and retailers in the Boston District reported a cautious outlook. The Districts that reported on auto sales during the early summer months generally noted a decrease in recent sales.  Since the previous report, auto sales in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts declined, while auto sales in the Kansas City District increased and were unchanged in the Dallas District.  Compared with last year, auto sales in the Atlanta and St. Louis Districts were higher.  New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas all reported that inventory levels were low or declining.  Auto dealers anticipate little change in sales for the rest of 2010 in the Philadelphia District and expect sales to increase slowly in the Dallas District.  Contacts in the Kansas City District expect continued strong demand, while those in the Cleveland District do not anticipate strong growth in the coming months. Real Estate and Construction Nearly all Districts reported sluggish housing markets in the months since the homebuyer tax credit expired on April 30.  While some Districts, such as Boston and St. Louis, reported an increase in May and June home sales on a year-over-year basis, some contacts noted that these sales may reflect closings of homes under contract by the April tax credit deadline.  The Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts reported that home sales are expected to weaken going forward.  Residential construction remained limited in several Districts.  In the Atlanta District, residential construction activity softened from already weak levels.  Homebuilders in the Cleveland District do not expect a turnaround in new home construction any time this year.  Builders in the Chicago District are not introducing new inventory without a signed contract on a home.  Housing starts were expected to decline for the second half of the year in the Dallas District and to increase slightly over the next three months in the Kansas City District. Commercial and industrial real estate markets continued to struggle in all twelve Districts.  Overall, vacancy rates were flat to slightly increased and continued to exert downward pressure on rents.  Construction activity remained weak in most Districts.  The New York District noted that commercial development remained generally sluggish despite some pickup in office and retail leasing in New York City.  Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas reported that construction activity continued to be weak or to decline, and Cleveland reported that the increase in construction from previous reports has begun to diminish.  Philadelphia reported that projects funded with federal stimulus support were near completion with no prospects for additional major construction, while Chicago reported that public infrastructure construction picked up.  Developers reported difficult credit conditions in the Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts, while the Dallas District reported a few developers going out of business.  The outlook for commercial and industrial real estate across the Districts ranged from further declines in activity to slow growth. Banking and Finance Reports on banking conditions were largely mixed across the Districts.  Banking activity in Richmond and loan demand in Kansas City increased modestly.  Overall loan demand was reported as soft or weak in Cleveland, Atlanta, and Dallas, while total outstanding loan volume decreased in recent months in St. Louis but was steady in Philadelphia and San Francisco.  Demand for commercial loans was flat to increasing in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts; in contrast, St. Louis reported a decrease in commercial loans outstanding, while New York, Atlanta, and San Francisco reported restrained or decreasing demand in this lending category.  Demand for consumer loans was weak in Cleveland and eased in Philadelphia; Atlanta and St. Louis indicated a decline in consumer lending; but demand for consumer loans increased in New York and Kansas City.  Demand for residential mortgage loans eased in the Philadelphia District but increased in the New York District; Cleveland reported residential mortgage activity below expectations at given rates; and real estate lending decreased in St. Louis.  Credit was limited for commercial real estate loans in Chicago, and demand fell for these loans in New York and Kansas City.  Most Districts reporting on credit standards continued to note that lending standards remain restrictive.  New York reported tighter credit standards for all categories except consumer loans, while Kansas City reported tighter commercial lending standards.  Reports on credit quality were mixed in Cleveland and Kansas City, while quality was stable in San Francisco.  Credit quality improved slightly in Philadelphia, Richmond, and Chicago.  In the Dallas District, nonperforming loans have stabilized and are not expected to worsen.  Meanwhile, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Richmond continued to report delinquencies above historic norms.  Delinquency rates in the New York District decreased for consumer loans but experienced little or no change in other categories. Agriculture and Natural Resources Recent rains improved the dry conditions in the Minneapolis and Dallas Districts and reduced irrigation needs in the Kansas City District.  In contrast, excess precipitation caused some crop damage in the Chicago District and some delays in the winter wheat harvest in the Kansas City District.  Parts of the Atlanta District experienced some crop stress due to dryness and heat.  Contacts reported that crops were in good condition overall in the Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts, but crop conditions worsened slightly in recent weeks in the Chicago District and were mixed in the St. Louis District compared with last year.  Producers in the Chicago District continued to expect good yields for their corn and soybean crops, and the outlook for cotton yields in the Dallas District has improved. Overall, activity in the energy sector increased since the previous report.  Oil production in the Atlanta District and oil and natural gas production in the Cleveland District were relatively unchanged, but other activity picked up throughout the Districts during the reporting period.  The number of drilling rigs increased in the Dallas District, and production continued to expand in the Kansas City District.  Additionally, oil exploration in the Minneapolis District and oil extraction in the San Francisco District increased.  Activity in the Minneapolis District's mining sector increased in recent weeks, as did production and demand for coal in the Cleveland District.  Kansas City reported that contacts expect to see continued growth in energy production.   Labor Markets, Wages, and Prices Labor market conditions improved gradually in several Districts.  New York, Chicago, Minneapolis, Richmond, and Atlanta all reported that labor markets improved, albeit modestly in some cases, while Boston and Dallas reported that employment was steady.  Philadelphia, Atlanta, Richmond, Chicago, and Minneapolis reported that temporary employment experienced increased demand.  Contacts in the Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts said that they continued to rely on temporary staff over permanent hires.  Cleveland, Richmond, and Chicago saw hiring in the manufacturing sector.  Cleveland also reported some new job openings in the healthcare industry.  Boston and Cleveland noted that firms in some services industries were hiring mostly for replacement.  Dallas reported that firms in the energy industry experienced significant regional layoffs as a result of the deepwater drilling moratorium.  San Francisco noted continued high levels of unemployment and limited hiring. Wage pressures remained largely contained across most Districts.  Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco reported little or no change in wages, while Cleveland, Chicago, and Kansas City reported that wage pressures were small or remained subdued.  Dallas reported that wage pressures were mostly nonexistent, with the exception of the airline industry. Prices of final goods and services were relatively stable in most Districts.  Several Districts indicated that prices of raw materials also held steady, and only a few Districts reported input price increases.  Steel prices moved slightly higher in the San Francisco District, but Cleveland and Chicago reported that steel prices were down.  Chicago and San Francisco noted an increase in energy prices, but Atlanta reported that energy prices were mostly stable since the onset of the Gulf oil spill.  Increased prices were noted for some metals by the Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts.  Transportation costs increased in the Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, and the Richmond District noted that shipping lines were attempting to raise rates.",2010-07-28
68,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco based on information collected on or before August 30, 2010.  This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.   Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggested continued growth in national economic activity during the reporting period of mid-July through the end of August, but with widespread signs of a deceleration compared with preceding periods. Economic growth at a modest pace was the most common characterization of overall conditions, as provided by the five western Districts of St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. The reports from Boston and Cleveland also pointed to positive developments or net improvements compared with the previous reporting period.  However, the remaining Districts of New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago all highlighted mixed conditions or deceleration in overall economic activity. Consumer spending appeared to increase on balance despite continued consumer caution that limited nonessential purchases, while activity in the travel and tourism sector picked up relative to seasonal norms.  Activity was largely stable or up slightly for professional and other nonfinancial services.  Reports on manufacturing activity pointed to further expansion, although the pace of growth eased according to several Districts.  Agricultural producers and extractors of natural resources reported continued gains in demand and sales.  Home sales slowed further following an initial drop after the expiration of the homebuyer tax credit at the end of June, prompting a slowdown in construction activity as well. Demand for commercial real estate remained quite weak but showed signs of stabilization in some areas.  Reports from financial institutions pointed to generally stable or slightly lower loan demand and noted some modest improvements in credit quality.  Upward price pressures remained quite limited for most categories of final goods and services, despite higher prices for selected commodities such as grains and some industrial materials.  Wage pressures also were limited, although a few Districts noted increased upward pressures in a narrow set of sectors experiencing a mismatch between job requirements and applicant skills. Consumer Spending and Tourism Reports on consumer spending were mixed but suggested a slight increase on balance.  Most Districts reported that non-automotive retail sales rose compared with the previous reporting period or were above their levels from 12  months earlier. By contrast, Atlanta  reported a decline in the level of sales, and Richmond noted that sales  ""sputtered"" in August, while New York and Dallas reported that growth in retail  sales slowed. Several Districts noted an  emphasis on necessities and lower-priced goods.  Boston reported that back-to-school purchases were focused on immediate  needs; in Cleveland, consumers focused on ""value-priced seasonal items;"" and in  St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco, sales were relatively stronger for lower-priced  items. Spending on big-ticket items such  as expensive consumer electronics was weak according to Philadelphia, Richmond,  and Dallas. Most Districts also reported  that sales of new automobiles and light trucks were largely stable or up  slightly during the reporting period, and contacts were optimistic for stable  sales or slight growth over the balance of the year. A few reports indicated that inventories for  various goods remained near desired levels despite slower sales in some cases,  as retailers have been practicing very tight inventory management. Reports  from most Districts pointed to consistent gains in travel and tourist activity,  with pickups evident in the business and leisure segments alike. New York reported strong tourist activity  that kept hotel occupancy rates high in Manhattan despite an increase in hotel  capacity this year, while Boston noted that travel and tourism activity was  ""stronger than expected."" Several other  Districts also reported rising visitor counts and hotel occupancies, notably  for popular tourist destinations in the Richmond, Minneapolis, and San  Francisco Districts, although several pointed to continued softness in  per-visitor spending. Atlanta noted reduced  tourist activity in areas of the Gulf Coast affected by the oil spill but  improvements over last year in unaffected areas. Airline traffic was stable to up, with Boston  pointing to an expanded number of low-fare carriers.  Nonfinancial Services Activity  was largely stable or up slightly for professional and other nonfinancial services. Providers of information technology (IT)  services such as computer software saw substantial revenue and sales gains in  the Boston and Kansas City Districts, with increased demand for IT labor reported  in Chicago as well. Demand for  professional services such as accounting held largely steady, with Minneapolis  and Dallas noting increases for selected types of consulting and legal services. Conditions were mixed for providers of real  estate services, as heightened appraisal activity for refinancing purposes was offset  by depressed home sales and consequent limited needs for agents and brokers. Demand for temporary staffing services  remained on an upward trend, with increases noted by Boston, Philadelphia,  Richmond, and Minneapolis, although Chicago pointed to a slight softening  during the reporting period. Reports  from the health-care sector were mixed:  Boston, Cleveland, and Chicago reported ongoing increases in demand for  health-care workers, while Philadelphia indicated a flattening in demand for  health-care services and San Francisco noted a decline in the frequency of  elective procedures and routine tests. Demand  for shipping and transportation services generally expanded, although according  to Cleveland the pace of growth slowed and contacts there expect little change  from existing volumes in the near term.  Manufacturing Manufacturing  activity expanded further on balance, although the pace of growth appeared to  be slower than earlier in the year. Most  Districts reported further gains in production activity and sales across a  broad spectrum of manufacturing industries.  However, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago noted that the overall  pace of growth slowed, while Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Kansas City reported  that demand softened compared with the previous reporting period. Recent weakness was most notable for  construction-related products, according to reports from Cleveland, Richmond,  Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco. By  contrast, orders and activity edged up for makers of steel and other metals in  Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis, propelled largely by demand from the transportation  equipment industry. Activity among automobile  makers and parts suppliers rose further in Richmond and held steady in Chicago,  although it dropped temporarily in Cleveland as a result of factory  retooling. Manufacturing activity for  commercial aircraft was steady in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts,  although a contact in Boston reported that the industry's recovery has been  slow. In the Boston and San Francisco  Districts, makers of semiconductors and other high-tech products saw further  sales gains, while Dallas noted that demand held largely steady at existing high  levels. Among nondurable products, food  processing stepped up in Philadelphia and San Francisco. Demand conditions for paper products were  mixed, with increased sales and expansion plans noted in Minneapolis and St.  Louis but flat to declining sales identified in Dallas. Export demand was an important contributor to  healthy conditions in the manufacturing sector according to Boston and Chicago,  notably for heavy machinery and autos. Reports  on capacity utilization were mixed.  Manufacturers of high-tech products have been operating near maximum  capacity of late, although this partly reflects a substantial decline in  industry-wide capacity over the past three years, as noted by Dallas. More generally, the majority of Cleveland's manufacturing  contacts reported that capacity utilization remained below pre-recession  levels. Capital spending plans for  manufacturers and firms in other industries generally indicate little change or  modest increases in coming months, based on reports from the Boston,  Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts.  Real Estate and Construction    Activity  in residential real estate markets declined further. Most District reports highlighted evidence of  very low or declining home sales, which many attributed to a sustained lull  following the expiration of the homebuyer tax credit at the end of June. Some Districts, such as New York and Dallas,  noted that the expiration of the tax credit created especially weak conditions  for lower-priced homes, while others, including Philadelphia and Kansas City,  identified the high end of the market as the primary weak spot. Residential construction activity declined in  most areas in response to weak demand.  Cleveland, St. Louis, and Minneapolis were the exceptions to this  pattern of declining activity, with reports from their contacts indicating that  residential construction activity improved of late. Inventories of available homes rose in general,  although the availability of new homes in Atlanta was held down by the slow  pace of new home construction. Price  movements were mixed, with most Districts reporting stability or declines of  late; a few, notably Boston, Minneapolis, and San Francisco, noted that prices  rose in some areas compared with the previous reporting period or last year. Richmond reported that recent home sales were  ""dominated by foreclosure and short sales,"" and Chicago reported an increase in  the supply of foreclosed homes for sale.  Demand  for commercial, industrial, and retail space generally remained depressed. Vacancy rates stayed at elevated levels in  general and rose further in a few Districts, placing substantial downward  pressure on rents. Asking rents continued  to decline in parts of the New York and Kansas City Districts. High vacancies and negative absorption held  nonresidential construction activity to the bare minimum in most  Districts. A few Districts reported  exceptions to weak conditions. Cleveland  noted improved construction activity for industrial use and educational  infrastructure; this raised overall activity above year-earlier levels and prompted  modest hiring by builders. Chicago  reported an increase in inquiries for commercial redevelopment and rising construction  activity for public projects, but Richmond reported that state and local  governments cut back on construction projects. Banking and Finance  Lending  activity was stable to down slightly on net.  Most Districts reported little or no change from existing low levels of  commercial and industrial lending, as businesses remained quite cautious about  expansion plans. Dallas and San  Francisco reported that overall lending trailed off, with declines driven by  weak business lending stemming in large part from uncertainty about future  economic conditions. Consumer lending  remained sluggish in general, with contacts in Philadelphia and Richmond  emphasizing the role of households' ongoing efforts to reduce their debt  burdens. A recent flurry of refinancing  activity spurred increased demand for residential mortgages in the New York,  Cleveland, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts, but new-purchase mortgage  originations remained quite sluggish in general. A few Districts pointed to increases in nonbank  financing activity, including rising availability of trade credit in Atlanta  and further increases in venture capital funding in San Francisco. Lending standards  were largely unchanged. However, New  York reported tighter standards in all lending categories, particularly for  commercial mortgages, and Kansas City reported that a few banks tightened  standards for commercial real estate loans. By contrast, reports from Chicago indicated  that credit availability and terms loosened for business and consumer  loans. Credit quality also changed  little on balance. Philadelphia,  Chicago, and San Francisco noted modest improvements in overall credit quality,  while New York reported rising delinquencies for all categories except consumer  loans and Atlanta reported an increase in business and household bankruptcies.  Agriculture and Natural Resources    Demand  for agricultural products continued to expand, and producers benefited from  relatively tranquil supply conditions.  Crops and livestock generally sold well in Districts with extensive  agricultural sectors, including Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and  San Francisco. Domestic growers have  seen increased demand for grains and other commodities as a result of shortages  overseas. Growing conditions were  supportive of relatively high yields in most areas, although volatile weather  conditions held corn and soybean yields below the record levels expected  earlier in the season in the Chicago District.  Low moisture during parts of the growing season also undermined yields  for selected crops in the Richmond and St. Louis Districts, most notably for  corn. Demand  and extraction activity increased for producers of natural resource products,  including oil and other items used for energy output. Rising global demand spurred expanded  extraction activity for oil, natural gas, and assorted minerals, as reported by  Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. In the Atlanta District, oil production was  barely affected by the Gulf oil spill, although contacts noted lingering  concerns about the longer-term business impacts of the deepwater drilling  moratorium and higher liability insurance costs for oil extraction companies. Prices and Wages    Upward  price pressures were very limited during the reporting period, with the  exception of selected food commodities and industrial materials. Philadelphia reported increases in the prices  of primary metals and wood products, Minneapolis pointed to higher prices for  copper and lead, and Dallas and San Francisco reported higher prices for grain  and selected other agricultural commodities.  Atlanta reported that commodity and transportation-related prices rose,  but their contacts indicated plans to absorb the increases into their margins  rather than passing them on to consumers.  Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco also noted limited pass-through  of cost pressures to downstream prices.    Wage  pressures remained modest overall. Of  Districts commenting on wages, most identified little or no upward pressures or  increases. Dallas reported that wage  pressures were ""generally nonexistent,"" with the exceptions of some airline and  temporary workers. Hiring of permanent  employees was held down in part by employers' reliance on temporary and  contract workers, as reported by Philadelphia and Atlanta, although Boston  noted that conversions from temporary to permanent staff picked up. Contacts in the Boston, Chicago, and Kansas  City Districts noted skill mismatches between available jobs and the workers  applying for them, which caused a slight uptick in wage pressures for selected  jobs in a narrow set of industries. More  generally, however, the reports suggested ample supply of qualified applicants  for open positions.",2010-09-08
69,"Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas based on information collected on or before October 8, 2010. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.   Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that, on balance, national economic activity continued to rise, albeit at a modest pace, during the reporting period from September to early October.  Manufacturing activity continued to expand, with production and new orders rising across most Districts. Demand for nonfinancial services was reported to be stable to modestly increasing overall. Consumer spending was steady to up slightly, but consumers remained price-sensitive, and purchases were mostly limited to necessities and nondiscretionary items. New vehicle sales held steady or rose during the reporting period; sales of used automobiles were strong as well. Activity in the travel and tourism sector picked up. Housing markets remained weak with most Districts reporting sales below year-ago levels. Reports on prices suggested stability, however. Conditions in the commercial real estate sector were subdued, and construction was expected to remain weak. Lending activity was stable in most Districts. Agricultural conditions were generally favorable, and above-average yields were expected in most reporting Districts. Activity in the energy sector continued to expand. Input costs, most notably for agricultural commodities and industrial metals, rose further. Shipping rates increased, and retailers in some Districts noted rising wholesale prices. However, prices of final goods and services were mostly stable as higher input costs were not passed on to consumers. Wage pressures were minimal. Manufacturing Manufacturing activity continued to expand, and several Districts reported gains in production or new orders across a wide range of industries. The only exceptions were the Philadelphia and Richmond Districts, where activity softened compared with the previous reporting period. Exports boosted manufacturing activity according to contacts in the Cleveland, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts. Producers of semiconductors and other high-tech equipment saw continued growth in sales in the Boston, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Auto production rose strongly in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts. Metals producers in the Chicago District reported that September sales were the strongest year-to-date, while contacts in the Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts saw only modest gains. Shipments of steel in the Cleveland District continued to be buoyed by demand from energy-related, automotive, and heavy equipment industries. Food processors in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts noted solid demand for their products, while a few contacts in the St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts reported plans to expand existing operations. Refiners in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts noted a slowdown in activity and rising inventories. Demand for construction-related products remained weak, and reports on activity in the wood products and furniture manufacturing industries were mixed. Hiring at manufacturing firms remained sluggish. Inventories were generally light or in line with orders. Future capital spending plans appeared to be limited, except for in the St. Louis District where several manufacturers reported plans to build new plants or expand operations. Manufacturers' assessments of future factory activity were optimistic in the New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts, where contacts expect business conditions to remain positive or to improve in coming months. Nonfinancial Services Activity was stable to modestly increasing for most professional and nonfinancial services. Demand for information technology (IT) services remained solid. IT firms in the San Francisco District noted recent growth was spurred by business investment to enhance production efficiency. In the Minneapolis District firms noted solid demand for IT services from corporate clients. Accounting activity improved slightly, spurred by merger and acquisition work. Contacts in the Boston and Dallas Districts noted increases in consulting activity since the last report. Healthcare consulting picked up as businesses responded to regulatory changes following healthcare reform. Appraisal and title companies noted continued strength during the reporting period, and there were some reports from architectural firms that activity had picked up. Demand for transportation services appears to have slowed, although reports were mixed. Freight companies in the Cleveland District noted steady to declining volumes over the past six weeks, and Kansas City's report said transportation firms saw unexpected weakness. Rail companies in the Atlanta District reported positive, but slower growth of automobile and industrial goods shipments, while port activity in the Richmond District was mixed. Dallas' report said intermodal and railroad cargo volumes edged up, but growth in international container trade volumes flattened, and small parcel shipping volumes declined in September. San Francisco reported a pickup in demand for trucking services. Consumer Spending and Tourism Retail spending was flat to moderately positive in most Districts, with the exception of the Richmond and Atlanta Districts, which noted declining traffic and sales. Contacts in the Kansas City District noted sales were stronger than expected; back-to-school spending boosted sales in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts. Retail spending grew modestly in the Minneapolis and San Francisco Districts, and was flat in the Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts. Retailers said consumers are slowly regaining confidence, but remain price-conscious and were largely limiting purchases to necessities and nondiscretionary items. There were reports, however, of a pickup in sales of moderately priced household goods in the Philadelphia, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, and gains in apparel sales were reported in the Atlanta and Chicago Districts. Inventories were at desired levels. Looking ahead, retailers in several Districts expected modest sales growth through year-end. In particular, some contacts in New York planned to add more holiday staff than last year. Most Districts reported that sales of new vehicles held steady or rose during the reporting period. Sales of used vehicles were strong as well. Inventories remained tight, particularly for popular vehicles. Used car prices rose, reflective of solid demand and lean inventories. Respondents' outlooks were for slight growth in sales through year-end. Reports from most Districts pointed to continued improvement in travel and tourist activity. The Richmond District reported that tourist activity strengthened, and contacts in San Francisco noted that growth in business travel and convention activity led to rising visitor counts and hotel occupancy rates. Hotel occupancy for popular tourist destinations in the Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts also rose during the reporting period and was above year-ago levels. New York's report noted that hotel occupancy rates remained high in Manhattan, but October bookings were somewhat weaker than expected. Atlanta noted that tourist activity in some areas was still being affected by the Gulf oil spill, but losses incurred in these areas were offset by increased activity in Northeast Florida, Georgia, and Tennessee and respondents' outlooks for the remainder of the year were positive. Airline traffic was stable to slightly down according to the Dallas District, but conditions were much better than a year earlier thanks to strength in business travel. Restaurants and food service contacts in the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts also noted slight increases in activity.   Real Estate and Construction Housing markets remained weak. Most District Beige Book reports suggested overall home sales were sluggish or declining and were below year-ago levels. There were scattered reports of some improvement in sales in a few Districts, however. Philadelphia noted an increase in sales of existing homes, and Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas reported upticks in sales of higher-priced homes. Sales reports were mixed in the St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts, with increases in some metro areas and declines in others. Home inventories were elevated or rising according to most District reports. Home prices were generally stable since the last report, although Kansas City noted a decrease in prices, and New York and Minneapolis reported declines in some metros. Homebuilders in the Atlanta District reported downward price pressure and expressed concern about rising foreclosures and bank-owned properties coming to market. Single-family construction activity was at very low levels, but had improved somewhat in the Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts. Atlanta reported a softening of construction activity overall, and Minneapolis said single-family building activity was mixed across metros. Builders in the Dallas District said they had pulled back on starts considerably after the run-up earlier in the year.  Respondents' outlooks suggested sales and construction would remain subdued through year-end. There were some reports that tighter credit standards for buyers and small builders, along with general economic uncertainty, were stalling activity. Conditions in the commercial real estate sector remained subdued. Reports suggested rental rates continued to decline for most commercial property types. The one exception was the apartment sector, where higher leasing activity led to fewer concessions, most notably in Manhattan. Office, industrial and retail rental markets remained weak, although there were a few reports of slight increases in leasing activity in the Richmond, Chicago and Dallas Districts. Commercial property sales were low overall, but contacts in the Chicago and Dallas Districts said investment demand for distressed commercial properties remained strong. Given lackluster demand for commercial space, nonresidential construction activity was limited to mostly public projects, according to District reports. Industry contacts appeared to believe that the commercial real estate and construction sectors would remain weak for some time. Banking and Finance Lending activity was stable at low levels across most Districts, but there were some reports that demand picked up slightly. The Richmond and Dallas District reports noted increased lending activity, and Chicago said credit conditions continued to improve in the District. Reports from Richmond and Dallas suggested that competition for quality loans had picked up. Some contacts noted there was pressure to price loans slightly more aggressively. Demand for commercial and industrial loans remained weak as businesses continued to postpone capital spending plans because of economic and public policy uncertainties. However, merger and acquisition lending picked up in a few Districts. Commercial real estate lending remained subdued and loan standards were still tight. On the consumer side, lending was sluggish, but there were scattered reports of improvement. Contacts in the Cleveland and Dallas Districts reported growth in auto loans. Residential mortgage lending and refinancing activity increased in several Districts, and San Francisco reported an increase in demand for nonconforming mortgage loans.   Credit quality changed little on balance. New York reported a decrease in delinquency rates on consumer loans, however, and overall quality improved in the Philadelphia and Richmond Districts, according to reports. Agriculture and Natural Resources Agricultural conditions were mostly favorable. Fall harvest was generally ahead of its normal pace, and above-average yields were expected in most reporting Districts. There were a few exceptions, however. Widespread rains flooded farmland and delayed harvests in the Minneapolis District while dry weather affected some crops in the Atlanta and St. Louis Districts. Unfavorable weather conditions and resulting crop losses abroad continued to boost export demand for U.S. agricultural products. Commodity prices strengthened further, boosting optimism among producers in the Dallas District and spurring higher cropland values and capital spending on agricultural equipment in the Kansas City District. Additionally, corn producers in the Chicago District were holding on to recently harvested corn in hope of even higher prices. The energy sector continued to expand, with activity rising further in the Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. The Minneapolis District reported that mines were operating near capacity, and coal production was robust in the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts. Firms in the Dallas District noted strong domestic land-based drilling and a pickup in overseas demand had offset losses resulting from the moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico. The Cleveland and Kansas City Districts reported that strong activity had prompted hiring and an increase in capital spending at some energy firms. Respondents' outlooks were mostly positive, although low natural gas prices had dampened the outlook for producers in the Cleveland and Dallas Districts. Prices and Wages Input costs rose slightly, but prices of final goods and services were stable across Districts. Upward pressures on agricultural commodities and industrial metals prices were reported by several Districts. In addition, shipping costs increased in the Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Dallas Districts, and retailers in the Philadelphia and Chicago Districts reported higher wholesale prices. Pass-through of rising input costs to final prices remained limited although there were scattered reports of increases. Prices of petrochemicals rose in the Dallas District, and a few manufacturers in the Boston District said recent price increases on some of their products had been successful. Some manufacturers in the Atlanta District noted rising costs of materials and employee benefits would likely be passed on to customers in the near-term, and several manufacturers in the Cleveland District announced plans to raise product prices in an attempt to recover rising costs. In response to rising food costs, food producers in the Dallas District reported plans to raise prices, and menu prices at restaurants rose modestly in the Kansas City District. Wage pressures remained minimal. Most District reports found little evidence of wage increases in general. There were widespread reports across Districts that firms anticipated increased costs of employee benefits as a result of healthcare reform. Hiring remained limited, with many firms reluctant to add to permanent payrolls given economic softness. Reports from staffing firms were mixed. Staffing firms in the New York and Dallas Districts noted a slowdown in demand for their services, and contacts in the Cleveland District said new job openings declined. Richmond's report noted demand for temporary workers picked up slightly since the last report, and staffing contacts in the Philadelphia District said clients were adding positions as workloads increased. The Atlanta report noted a preference for increasing staff hours and using temporary help rather than hiring additional full-time staff.",2010-10-20
70,"Prepared by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland based on information collected on or before November 19, 2010.  This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.   Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that the economy continued to improve, on balance, during the reporting period from early/mid-October to mid-November.  Economic activity in the Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts increased at a slight to modest pace, while a somewhat stronger pace of economic activity was seen in New York, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City.  Philadelphia and St. Louis reported business conditions as mixed. Manufacturing activity continued to expand in almost all Districts, with relatively strong growth seen in metal fabrication and the automotive industries.  Reports also showed steady to increasing activity for professional and nonfinancial services.  Two Districts noted a decline in demand from government agencies due to budgetary shortfalls.  Reports on consumer spending tended to be positive.  Nonetheless, several Districts noted that households remain price sensitive and focused on buying necessities.  Expectations for the holiday shopping season were generally positive, with several Districts expecting higher sales when compared to year-ago levels.  Sales of new cars and light trucks were largely higher than in our last report.  Tourism improved in all reporting Districts. Housing markets remain depressed, with several Districts reporting further weakening during the past six weeks.  Conditions in commercial real estate were mixed, and activity stayed at low levels.

New York was the only District where manufacturing activity was reported to have weakened, while Dallas reported that manufacturing was mixed.  Metal fabrication increased in Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco.  Contacts in automotive industries reported gains in Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago.  The Boston, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts reported increased sales for high-technology manufacturers, though Dallas noted that growth in orders and production in high-technology industries had slowed from earlier in the year.  Steel producers and service centers in the Cleveland District reported that volume was either flat or improving, while Chicago noted some temporary softening in steel demand.  Refiners in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts noted reduced production levels.  The Philadelphia and Dallas Districts indicated little improvement in demand for manufacturers with ties to residential housing and construction.   The Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Kansas City Districts reported that capital spending or spending plans had increased.  On net, manufacturers in the St. Louis District reported they planned to expand operations.  Contacts in Boston, New York, and Richmond commented on increasing input costs.  Several Districts noted an optimistic outlook from manufacturers.  Boston and Richmond described manufacturers as upbeat; New York and Chicago reported contacts as more optimistic; and Philadelphia and Minneapolis manufacturers expect increases in activity in the near term.  However, several contacts in Dallas expressed concern about a decline in demand from government agencies, as budget shortfalls continue. Nonfinancial Services  Activity was steady to increasing for professional and nonfinancial services across most Districts.  The exception was the St. Louis District, which reported a decline in service sector activity.  Boston, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and San Francisco noted growth in information technology services. Accounting demand remained stable in the Dallas District, bolstered by consulting and merger and acquisition work.  The healthcare sector was said to be expanding in reports from Philadelphia and St. Louis, though Richmond noted no change in demand.  Firms that provide services to governments in the  Philadelphia District indicated that their clients were using less of their services because of the tight budget environment.  Demand for transportation services increased in several Districts.  Freight companies in Cleveland noted that volumes increased slightly during the past six weeks, and contacts in Atlanta said freight volumes had improved from a year ago, with both Districts recognizing gains in chemical shipments.  Regional rail contacts in Dallas noted strong increases in volume.  Contacts in Dallas said that intermodal transportation firms experienced increased cargo volumes, buoyed by demand from international clients, as well as a rise in international container trade volumes.  Kansas City reported that the transportation sector stabilized but noted a shortage of qualified drivers. Consumer Spending and Tourism Retail spending showed improvement across most Districts, with the exception of Boston, Cleveland, Richmond and St. Louis, where results were mixed.  A return to more seasonably cool weather was credited for boosting sales in the New York and Dallas Districts.  Grocers reported rising sales in Cleveland and Richmond, while sales dropped off in San Francisco.  Purchases of apparel improved in the Philadelphia, Chicago, and Dallas Districts.  Expectations for the holiday shopping season were positive across Districts; however, in Richmond, retailers expected holiday shopping to be restrained.  Reports from the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts indicated that consumers remained value conscious and tended to focus on buying necessities.  Purchases of big ticket items were soft in Richmond, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Sales of new automobiles and light trucks rose in nine Districts during the reporting period, with several Districts indicating that vehicle inventories are now at appropriate levels.  Dealers expect new vehicle sales to continue rising through year-end in the Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts. Tourism was characterized as stronger or improved in the Boston, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, while business travel to destinations in the New York, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts increased.  Occupancy rates at hotels in Manhattan and  Atlanta's major markets were higher than a year ago.  The Richmond and Atlanta Districts noted a pickup in international visitors.  In Boston, increased tourism was attributed to generous travel incentives and perceived value, while Richmond noted that discretionary retail spending by tourists was lower. Real Estate and Construction Residential real estate and construction activity remained at a low level in all Districts.  The Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Districts reported some further weakening in home sales. Boston, New York, and Richmond characterized the market as soft; while Cleveland, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco described the market as sluggish.  The Chicago District reported that high inventories of unsold homes continued to be a drag on new residential construction and home prices.  Residential house prices were mixed.  Price declines were observed in New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Kansas City; prices were flat to up in Minneapolis, and prices edged up in Boston.  The Dallas District reported that home prices increased on a year-over-year basis.  The rental market continued to offer incentives to tenants in New York, while strong demand for rental units was reported in Richmond and Dallas.  Outlooks for 2011 were mixed. Conditions in the commercial real estate industry were mixed during the reporting period.  Several Districts reported flat demand and high vacancy rates, which translated into limited nonresidential construction activity.  The New York, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts noted some weakening in nonresidential activity, while the Boston and Dallas Districts indicated some modest improvement in commercial real estate.  Reports from Cleveland and Chicago noted that most new projects fell generally into the infrastructure category.  Contacts in Boston, Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas expressed some optimism about the near-term outlook in their Districts, but contacts in several other Districts expressed a more cautious outlook. Banking and Finance Banking conditions remained stable across most Districts.  Lending activity was reported as steady or unchanged in New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco, while a slight improvement was noted in Cleveland, Richmond and Chicago.  The Atlanta District reported constrained credit conditions and weak loan demand.  Contacts in Chicago and Dallas said that increased competition for high-quality borrowers resulted in more aggressive loan pricing.  Demand for commercial and industrial loans was generally stable, though several Districts noted improvements in specific loan categories.  The Cleveland and Chicago Districts reported increased lending for mergers and acquisitions, and access to credit by small businesses in Atlanta improved slightly.  Consumer lending has remained stable at weak levels in most Districts.  The San Francisco District reported that loan demand declined slightly as a result of households' desire to deleverage, while Chicago saw a small pickup in consumer lending.  Several Districts reported increases in lending related to residential real estate, and, in particular, to refinancing activity.  Reports on changes in credit standards were mixed.  Bankers in New York reported a tightening in credit standards across all loan categories, Kansas City contacts indicated no change in lending standards, and Atlanta reported an easing in standards for small firms.  Contacts in the Cleveland, Richmond, and Chicago Districts reported improved credit quality, but San Francisco bankers noted ongoing struggles with credit quality.  The Cleveland and Richmond Districts both reported declines in delinquencies. Agriculture and Natural Resources  Mainly favorable weather conditions helped facilitate early harvesting and the planting of winter crops.  The Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts reported large to record-setting yields for certain crops.  Agricultural prices continued to climb, boosting farm incomes.  Reports from several Districts indicated that higher grain prices were raising feed costs for livestock producers.  Nonetheless, contacts in Chicago noted that even with higher feed costs, margins for livestock producers remain positive.  Strong global demand and tight supplies pushed cotton prices to near historic highs for growers in Atlanta and Dallas.  San Francisco noted that reductions in overseas yields, combined with the lower value of the U.S. dollar, are helping boost domestic farm sales.  Activity in the energy sector was expanding.  The number of active drilling rigs increased in the Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts.  Although producers are interested in returning to the Gulf of Mexico, drilling remains well below pre-oil spill levels as permit issuance lags.  Producers in Kansas City expressed concern about future production due to labor and equipment shortages.  Cleveland reported an increase in production from Marcellus shale.  In the Minneapolis District, wind energy continued to expand, but at a slower pace than a year ago, while mining activity increased. Labor and Prices Hiring activity showed some improvement across most Districts, although employers are waiting for clearer signals of expanding business prospects before adding significantly to payrolls.  A preference for part-time and temporary workers was reported in the Atlanta and Chicago Districts.  Seasonal hiring in retail trade is expected to be higher this year in Chicago and San Francisco than in the previous two years.  Employers in the Boston, Richmond, and Minneapolis Districts reported having difficulty finding skilled workers.  Employment agencies in the New York, Richmond, and Chicago Districts reported a moderate increase in new job openings, while staffing firms in Dallas said that hiring activity is strong.  Boston staffing contacts noted that labor demand has strengthened, particularly in the information technology, medical, manufacturing, and legal sectors.  Wage pressures remain subdued across Districts.  Contacts in Richmond and Kansas City noted that they expect little change in wage pressures during the upcoming months.  However, employers in San Francisco reported significant increases in employee benefit costs. Prices of final goods and services were fairly stable across Districts despite rising input costs, especially for agricultural commodities, metals, and fuel.  Companies in the Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts reported a limited ability to pass through higher input costs to customers given the relative softness in demand.  However, some manufacturers in the Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta Districts have announced plans to raise their product prices in the near future.  Retailers in Philadelphia and San Francisco noted price increases on selected products imported from Asian countries.  Reports from the Chicago and Dallas Districts indicated that that record-high inventories and forecasts for a warmer-than-normal winter are putting downward pressure on natural gas prices.",2010-12-01
71,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District Summary    Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and based on information collected on or before January 3, 2011. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.            Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that economic activity continued to expand moderately from November through December. Conditions were said to be improving in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond Districts. Activity increased modestly to moderately in the Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. The economy of the Minneapolis District ""continued its moderate recovery,"" while that of the San Francisco District ""firmed further"" in the reporting period leading up to the close of 2010. Conditions were generally said to be better in Districts' manufacturing, retail, and nonfinancial services sectors than in financial services or real estate.                  Contacts in the manufacturing sector in all Districts reported that activity continued to recover, with the Richmond and Chicago Districts citing especially solid gains in orders. However, the Boston, Atlanta, and Dallas Districts noted that business remained weak for manufacturers selling into the construction sector. Retailers in all Districts indicated that sales appeared to be higher in this holiday season than in 2009 and, in some cases, better than expectations. Nonfinancial service-sector contacts in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts cited demand increases ranging from slight to ""relatively strong."" Transportation services were more mixed, with the Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts noting stable to slowing shipping volumes. Financial conditions were mixed across the Districts reporting on it, with overall loan demand slowly improving in Philadelphia and Richmond and weaker in St. Louis and Dallas. The Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts cited increased activity in the energy sector, while energy production in the Cleveland District was stable.              Residential real estate markets remained weak across all Districts. Commercial construction was described as subdued or slow, while commercial leasing activity reportedly increased in the Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts.              Most District reports cited comments by both retailers and manufacturers that costs were rising, but indicated that competitive pressures had led to only modest pass-through into final prices. Labor markets appeared to be firming somewhat in most Districts, as some modest hiring beyond replacement was said to have occurred and/or was planned in a variety of sectors. At the same time, however, upward pressure on wages was reportedly very limited.              Most Districts indicated that business contacts were positive about the outlook, although still generally cautious. The Dallas District noted modest increases in optimism and positive outlooks across a range of sectors, Chicago stated that contacts were cautiously optimistic about the 2011 outlook, and New York cited widespread optimism about the near-term outlook; The St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts all pointed to planned increases in hiring by their contacts as evidence of expected strengthening in business activity in 2011. Contacts in the Philadelphia District foresaw ""improving economic conditions in 2011, but  not strong growth.""       Manufacturing        The manufacturing sector continued to recover across all Districts. Contacts in the Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts identified a strong flow of new orders. Respondents in the Chicago District pointed to pent-up demand for both light and heavy motor vehicles, attributed to an aging fleet, as a key driver of activity in the manufacturing sector. The Cleveland District described orders as above expectations and respondents in the New York District noted that orders had picked up since the prior report. Overall, demand was generally characterized as stable and steady, and no District made mention of lingering fears of a double-dip recession, in contrast to the summer reporting periods. Capacity utilization continued to trend higher and is approaching normal rates for some contacts in the Cleveland and San Francisco Districts, while production in high-tech manufacturing was reportedly at high capacity in Dallas; some manufacturers in the St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts said they have or will soon expand capacity. Production levels increased in the Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts. On the negative side, the Philadelphia District characterized the flow of new orders as ""erratic,"" while the Boston, Atlanta, and Dallas Districts identified construction-related manufacturers as continuing to show considerable weakness, and makers of wood products in the St. Louis and San Francisco Districts reported very soft demand.              The Boston, Cleveland, and San Francisco Districts reported concerns about input prices, particularly of commodities; manufacturers in the Boston, Cleveland, and Richmond Districts indicated they had experienced lengthening lead times, shortages, or other difficulty obtaining supplies of some inputs. Only St. Louis mentioned firms with substantial investment plans for 2011. Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City reported that some factories had plans to increase employment, although these hiring plans were typically characterized as modest. The Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts described the 2011 manufacturing outlook as optimistic.       Consumer Spending and Tourism        Retail spending showed improvement across all Districts, with most retailers reporting sales growth consistent with or ahead of plan for the recent 2010 holiday season. Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City observed consumers positively reacting to promotions and discounting, although Philadelphia and San Francisco reported that retailers relied less heavily on discounting. Inclement weather, including the late December blizzard, had some impact on sales in the New York and Philadelphia Districts. New York , Cleveland, and Chicago cited increased consumer confidence.              Automobile sales were either steady or up in eight Districts during the reporting period, while New York stated that auto sales were ""mixed but generally at favorable levels"" and Kansas City noted limited auto sales but expected future improvement from additional incentives. Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Dallas indicated that vehicle inventories were at appropriate levels for the current sales rate. Cleveland reported an increase in leasing activity, while the effect of rising gasoline prices on sales of less fuel-efficient models was a concern cited by some dealers in Philadelphia.              Tourism was characterized as positive or improved in the Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, while New York described tourist activity as brisk. Contacts from the Richmond, Kansas City, and Minneapolis Districts observed a strong start to the winter ski season, although unfavorable weather conditions at the end of December led to deteriorating conditions for winter activities in some areas of the Minneapolis District. New York City's Broadway theaters reported increased attendance and revenue compared with the 2009 holiday season. Occupancy rose in the Atlanta and San Francisco Districts' major hotel markets. Room rates continued to run ahead of comparable 2009 levels in the New York and the Kansas City Districts, although rates have fallen in Kansas City since the last survey. Atlanta and San Francisco noted rising business travel.       Nonfinancial Services        Activity was said to be steady to increasing among Districts reporting on nonfinancial services. Providers of information technology services saw increases in sales in the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts. Advertising and consulting contacts in the Boston District reported significant growth in demand. In the Dallas District, legal firms noted an uptick in demand for services, while accounting firms reported seasonal slowness. Reports from the healthcare sector were mixed; St. Louis and Minneapolis reported ongoing increases in demand for healthcare workers, while San Francisco indicated a slight weakening in demand for healthcare services and Richmond reported little change. Demand for staffing services remained on an upward trend, with increases reported by New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, and Chicago. In addition, an employment-agency contact in the New York District observed increased demand for employees in the legal and financial services sectors, while the Dallas District noted strong, steady demand for workers in the professional, technical, healthcare, and finance fields. Reports from the transportation services sector were mixed, with increased demand reported by trucking firms and airports in the Richmond District, and slower overall activity in the Kansas City District. Freight companies in the Cleveland District noted stable volumes over the past six weeks, and contacts in the Atlanta District reported moderating freight volumes after significant increases in earlier 2010 reporting periods.       Real Estate and Construction        Activity in residential real estate and new home construction remained slow across all Districts. A majority of the Districts, including Boston, New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco characterized local housing markets as weak and sluggish with little change from the previous reporting period. Kansas City noted further weakening, while Richmond received reports of both flat activity and further declines. The St. Louis District saw additional declines in existing home sales, but also cited increased new home construction permits. All Districts attributed slumping activity to concerns about the pace of economic recovery, especially in employment, while the Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts mentioned difficulty obtaining credit as another constraint on demand. High levels of existing home inventories continued to damp the pace of new home construction in most Districts reporting on construction, although Boston, Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco mentioned pick-ups in multifamily construction within their Districts. Home prices generally declined or held steady in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts; the New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts mentioned distressed properties placing downward pressure on prices. Boston reported rising median home prices across most states in the District, but contacts attributed those increases to relatively higher sales of more expensive properties rather than a general upward movement in home prices. Outlooks for residential real estate in the coming year were mixed, with contacts in most Districts described as expecting continued weak conditions.              Commercial real estate markets displayed mixed results across the Districts again this reporting period, as leasing markets exhibited increasing signs of recovery and nonresidential construction remained weak. Leasing activity increased modestly in the Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts and showed tentative improvement in the Dallas District. Vacancy rates, while quite high across the country, fell marginally in the Kansas City District and in New York City's office market. Leasing market fundamentals held roughly steady in the Boston, Philadelphia, and San Francisco Districts. Commercial construction activity was described as very limited across most Districts, with the bulk of new activity coming from projects related to healthcare, public infrastructure, and multifamily housing. Contacts in most Districts expected modest improvements in commercial leasing in 2011, although the outlook for construction was mixed and some Districts noted rising costs as a concern.       Banking and Financial Services        Reports on credit activity were mixed across Federal Reserve Districts. Overall, loan demand was reported as stable in San Francisco, mixed in New York, steady to slightly softer in Kansas City, weaker in St. Louis and Dallas, and slowly improving in Philadelphia and Richmond. Demand for consumer loans declined in the New York, Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. By contrast, consumer lending increased in the Dallas District, and exceeded expectations in the Chicago District. Bankers in Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Richmond anticipate consumer lending to expand in 2011. Demand for commercial and industrial loans was flat in New York, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Lenders in the New York, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts noted a drop in residential mortgage refinancing owing to the recent rise in interest rates, whereas Richmond reported strong demand for home refinancing. The Cleveland and Richmond Districts observed a pick-up in auto lending. Demand for residential real estate loans eased in New York and Kansas City, remained weak in Cleveland and Dallas, but increased in the Richmond District. Real estate lending declined in the St. Louis District. Lending in the commercial mortgage category increased in New York, was unchanged in Kansas City, and was weak in Dallas, with the exception of multifamily. Most Districts reporting on credit quality described it as improving, while bankers in the Cleveland District said that quality remained stable or edged up slightly. Reports on credit standards were mixed in New York, while standards were said to have eased somewhat in Atlanta, remained restrictive in San Francisco, and held steady in Kansas City. Delinquency rates were flat or trending down in Cleveland, while delinquency rates in the New York District rose for commercial mortgages, decreased in the consumer lending category, and remained unchanged for all other loans. Total deposits rose in the Cleveland and St. Louis Districts and were stable in the Kansas City District.       Agriculture and Natural Resources        Unfavorable weather conditions damped agricultural production in some areas. The Dallas District reported that drought negatively affected range conditions by adding to costs of feeding livestock, while Atlanta cited the challenges prolonged drought presented to fruit growers. The Kansas City District indicated that dry weather could affect winter wheat development. Large snow falls hampered some ranchers in the Minneapolis District. However, agricultural demand generally improved among reporting Districts, and output prices rose, especially for corn, soybeans, wheat, cattle, and cotton.              The Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported increased drilling activity. Cleveland cited fairly stable oil production, while the Atlanta District experienced the highest level of oil production in more than six years during the fourth quarter of 2010. Prices for crude oil and natural gas either stayed steady or slightly increased in the Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Cleveland reported steady coal production and prices, while the St. Louis District saw coal production increase.       Prices and Labor Markets        Most District reports mentioned increasing prevalence of cost pressures but only modest pass-through into final prices because of competitive pressures. Philadelphia and San Francisco noted somewhat reduced discounting in the retail sector during the holiday selling season, while New York, Minneapolis, and Dallas indicated retail prices were stable, Richmond said retail price increases had slowed, and Chicago and Kansas City cited discounting or depressed retail margins. For both retailers and manufacturers, increases in selling prices, if occurring, were said to be selective. Specific markets or products identified as experiencing high or rising prices included various food products, steel and other metals, building materials, textiles, chemicals, and petroleum-related products. Many Districts mentioned concerns among business contacts that petroleum-related prices, already above year-earlier levels, will continue rising in 2011. The Philadelphia and Kansas City reports indicated that manufacturing firms planned to attempt more price increases in 2011, while some manufacturers in the Boston District were uncertain their price increases would stick and the Chicago report projected only ""limited and gradual"" pass-through.              Labor markets in most Districts appear to be firming somewhat, but with virtually no upward pressure on wages. All District reports indicated that employment levels are rising in at least some sectors, generally by modest amounts; however, some employers in the New York, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Districts also mentioned job cuts. Staffing firms in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas Districts gave positive reports; Cleveland, Richmond, and Atlanta said some firms were raising work hours instead of or in addition to hiring. The Boston, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts indicated that business contacts planned to continue or increase their pace of hiring in 2011. Some employers in the Boston, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts expressed concern about added costs for healthcare; the Boston, Cleveland, and Chicago Districts noted selected skill shortages in some sectors. Overall wage pressures remained subdued; the Philadelphia District reported ""mostly steady wages,"" Cleveland said ""wage pressures are contained,"" Chicago indicated ""wage pressures remained moderate,"" Minneapolis and Kansas City stated wage increases or wage pressure ""remained subdued,"" and the Dallas and San Francisco reports described wage pressures as ""minimal"" or ""largely absent.""",2011-01-12

Boston, Richmond, and Chicago reported more permanent job placements occurring in the market, while Atlanta businesses reported a continued preference for hiring temporary workers rather than permanent workers. Several Districts described an increase in demand for staffing services, especially for high-skilled IT positions. Adverse weather conditions continued to hamper agricultural production in many Districts, but strong prices helped producers of cotton, corn, soybeans, wheat, poultry, hogs and cattle. Energy production expanded or remained stable, according to reporting Districts.                             Non-wage input costs increased for manufacturers and retailers in most Districts. Manufacturers, in a number of Districts reported having greater ability to pass through higher input costs to customers.

Overall, contacts anticipate a slow recovery in commercial real estate markets.       Manufacturing        Reports from eleven of the twelve Reserve Banks indicated that manufacturing activity improved since the previous report, while St. Louis attributed a decline in manufacturing activity to several factory closings. Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City noted solid expansion in production, but Chicago observed a more moderate rise in output than in its last report. Cleveland, Atlanta, and Minneapolis indicated that adverse weather conditions temporarily disrupted production.

San Francisco reported that venture capital financing was improving with increased investor interest and IPO activity.       Agriculture and Natural Resources        Adverse weather conditions continued to hamper agricultural production in many areas. Extremely cold and/or dry conditions negatively affected crops or livestock in the Richmond, Atlanta, and Dallas Districts. Kansas City also reported poor growing conditions. St. Louis described mixed results for production in many crops, but large increases in rice and cotton production were noted. Most reporting Districts noted continued strong commodity prices were benefitting producers of cotton, corn, soybeans, wheat, poultry, hogs and cattle while there are also some reports of rising input prices, particularly in fertilizer and feed prices. San Francisco observed some boost in export sales for timber companies.              Energy activity expanded or remained stable since the last report.

73,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District    Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and based on information collected before April 4, 2011. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.            Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that economic activity generally continued to improve since the last report. While many Districts described the improvements as only moderate, most Districts stated that gains were widespread across sectors, and Kansas City described its economic gains as solid. Manufacturing continued to lead, with virtually every District citing examples of steady improvement, often with reports of increased hiring. Retailers in the Boston District reported mixed sales results and retail sales remained weak in the Richmond District, but all other Districts experienced at least slight gains in consumer spending and the New York District cited robust sales. Business services, including freight-related activities, improved in most Districts. Loan demand was either unchanged or up slightly in most Districts, with New York, St. Louis, and Kansas City citing weaker lending. Residential and commercial real estate performance varied across Districts. Seven of the Districts described commercial real estate as slightly improved, while five noted that their markets were flat. While most Districts noted little change in their residential real estate markets, half of the Districts cited at least pockets of weakening.                  Reports focusing on the near-term outlook were most often upbeat. Some Districts, however, also noted that uncertainties remained high. Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas all noted actual or expected disruptions to sales and production as a result of the tragedy in Japan. Most Districts reported signs of improvement in at least some of their labor markets and Boston, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City cited examples of concern among their contacts about being able to obtain certain types of skilled workers. Some businesses in the Philadelphia and Cleveland Districts still preferred to hire temporary over permanent workers.              Wage pressures were described by most Districts as weak or subdued, but higher commodity costs were widely reported to be putting increasing pressures on prices. Energy prices were cited most often, but raw materials in general were an increasing concern of businesses. The ability to pass through cost increases varied across Districts, with manufacturers generally finding less resistance to price increases than either retail or construction (where weak demand was a limiting factor).       Consumer Spending and Tourism        Consumer spending picked up modestly across most Districts since the last report. Consumers were shopping for necessities and looking for lower-priced options or promotional items in the Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts. New York reported strong retail sales in February and March, but noted weaker sales at two major retail chains in New York. Retailers in the Cleveland District reported higher sales relative to a year ago, although a few contacts cited considerable stress in the low- to mid-market segments. Richmond reported weak sales, including for big-ticket items, and Boston received mixed sales reports. Big-ticket sales, particularly for home furnishings, picked up in the Boston, Philadelphia, and Dallas Districts, but remained subdued in the San Francisco District.              Automobile sales rose in most Districts. Dallas noted higher foot traffic at auto dealers and Cleveland, Atlanta, and San Francisco indicated that improved availability of credit helped to boost car sales. In the Richmond District, however, vehicle sales were generally unchanged or sluggish, while dealers in the Chicago District reported a slight decline. Contacts in several Districts expressed concern about potential supply chain disruptions due to production problems in Japan.              Tourism strengthened in the New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, although Japanese tourism in Hawaii dropped. Tourist activity picked up in the Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts, as visitors enjoyed late-winter sports, and early attendance at the Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington, D.C. was above average. New York noted that hotel occupancy and attendance at Broadway theaters rose above year-ago levels.       Nonfinancial Services        Non-financial service firms generally reported expansion, although Minneapolis and Atlanta heard mixed reports. Demand for business-to-business services increased in the Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts. Boston and Minneapolis cited stronger demand for advertising and marketing services. In addition, respondents in several Districts reported higher demand for seasonal accounting services. Contacts at firms providing travel-related services in the Atlanta and Richmond Districts also reported an uptick in demand. Kansas City District restaurateurs said sales were up, but the average check amount had declined; in contrast, restaurant contacts in the Atlanta District gave mixed reports and some in the St. Louis District planned to decrease operations.              Reports from transportation services firms were mostly positive. Contacts in the Cleveland, Richmond, and Atlanta Districts reported an increase in freight transportation volume, notably for vehicles and construction materials. Dallas received mixed reports, however, citing weaker international demand for intermodal transportation; container volume flattened, while railroads reported moderate increases. Carriers in the Atlanta District reported increased air travel for business and leisure, while airlines in the Dallas District indicated traffic was steady. New York and Richmond cited a strengthening in freight trucking, and port activity rose in the Richmond and San Francisco Districts. Shippers in the Atlanta District anticipated temporary disruptions resulting from the disaster in Japan.       Manufacturing        All twelve Districts reported that manufacturing activity increased since their previous reports. Ten of the twelve Districts cited a further pickup in production, while Cleveland and Dallas observed steady to slightly improving activity. Dallas said overall demand in manufacturing rose slightly from low levels, noting gains in food, plastics, and construction-related products. Richmond and Chicago reported substantial increases in auto and auto parts manufacturing. Cleveland indicated that auto production overall dipped slightly, but that domestic automakers showed a substantial rise in production. Moreover, St. Louis mentioned that automobile parts and electrical equipment manufacturers reported plans to open new plants in their District. Boston and Kansas City reported that growth of high-tech goods was strong, but several contacts in the Dallas District said that high-tech shipments to Japanese factories declined. Boston and Richmond District respondents attributed a lack of new contracts from federal government agencies to the uncertainties surrounding the budget for fiscal year 2011. San Francisco reported that makers of commercial aircraft and related parts had modest growth in new orders, which they attributed in part to increased demand for aircraft with greater fuel efficiency. Philadelphia said that manufacturers of fabricated metal products and industrial machinery cited higher demand. Similarly, steel producers and metal service centers in the Cleveland District reported that shipping volume met or exceeded expectations, with shipments driven by energy-related, transportation, and heavy equipment.              Comments on the outlook were generally positive. Boston mentioned that manufacturers generally remained cautiously optimistic but voiced greater uncertainty about the outlook for the rest of the year, based on the disruption at Japanese facilities, the geopolitical climate worldwide, and ambiguity about U.S. government spending plans. Likewise, Chicago commented that contacts' optimism was tempered by elevated uncertainties surrounding recent global events. New York and Kansas City stated that contacts remained optimistic about the near-term outlook, and Philadelphia indicated that more than two-thirds of their manufacturers expected business conditions to improve in the next six months.       Real Estate and Construction        Real estate markets for single family homes for the most part either were little changed from low levels or continued to weaken across all Districts. Residential construction was described by Chicago as subdued and the spring building season is likely to be slower than previously anticipated. Market activity was still declining in the St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts, while activity in the New York, Cleveland, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts remained weak. Atlanta characterized the market as mixed, with Florida brokers providing most of the signs of improvement. Both Philadelphia and Atlanta noted that brokers expected the market to improve, and builders in the Cleveland District were more optimistic than in the past several months. A few Districts found pockets of improvement. For example, Philadelphia reported that agents were seeing a pickup in inquiries, showings, and traffic, although there was little increase in sales or construction. Boston noted higher activity in just the last few weeks, due in part to improved weather, and Richmond said that the market for lower-priced homes improved. The multifamily markets strengthened in several Districts, including Chicago, Dallas, Minneapolis, and San Francisco, both in terms of leasing and construction activity.              Commercial real estate activity remained weak across all Districts, although seven reported slight improvements since their last report. Market activity was still slow in the St. Louis and Philadelphia Districts and remained at low levels in the Boston, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts. Markets in the San Francisco District were characterized as subdued, but leasing activity increased among technology firms. Most other Districts noted improvements, albeit slight, in activity. For example, Chicago and Kansas City cited moderate gains in construction, with Chicago highlighting gains in healthcare and automotive industries. Improvements in the Cleveland District were also driven by healthcare projects and, to a lesser extent, by manufacturing and energy. Office and industrial leasing improved in the Richmond District, although retail was little changed.       Banking and Financial Services        Most Districts cited loan demand as either unchanged or slightly improved since the last report, although many of the Districts citing improvements noted weak demand in some market segments. Banks in the Chicago District noted that their pipeline was still not robust, although manufacturing, food processing, and healthcare experienced some growth. Cleveland reported that business lending was strongest in healthcare and in energy. Consumer loan demand showed some improvement in the Richmond and San Francisco Districts, but was little changed in the Chicago District. Overall loan demand was weak or little changed in the Philadelphia and Kansas City Districts, although Philadelphia noted some improvement in commercial and industrial loans and in some types of commercial real estate loans. However, New York described household demand (for both consumer loans and mortgages) as weakening in its District, and St. Louis noted declines across most segments of its market, including real estate, commercial and industrial, and personal loans.              Several Districts reported that credit standards were unchanged or slightly tighter and that competition for quality loans was intense. For example, Cleveland described credit standards as unchanged, while New York noted no change for consumer loans but tightening for other categories in its District. San Francisco noted that credit standards remained somewhat restrictive. Cleveland characterized loan quality as stable or slightly improved and delinquency rates as stable or trending down. However, New York mentioned an uptick in delinquency rates for commercial and industrial loans. Competition for quality loans was described as intense in the Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, putting downward pressures on rates and fees.       Employment, Wages, and Prices        Most Districts reported that labor market conditions were generally stronger than in their last reports. New York, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas all noted increased employment activity, while Boston and Atlanta reported modest or gradual improvement. However, Philadelphia, Cleveland and San Francisco mentioned limited or delayed hiring, while labor market conditions were mixed in the St. Louis District. Boston, New York, Cleveland, Richmond, and Dallas cited noticeable improvements in the manufacturing sector, and Boston and Kansas observed increased labor demand in the technology sector. New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Minneapolis received upbeat reports from staffing agencies. New York said that a major employment agency experienced a marked pickup in hiring activity in March, describing it as ""the best month in years."" A staffing contact in the Cleveland District noted moderate growth in the number of new job openings, with vacancies concentrated in health care, energy and professional business services. A large staffing firm in the Chicago District reported solid growth in billable hours and a substantial increase in permanent placement and recruiting activity, while contacts in the Philadelphia District were inclined to delay additions to permanent or temporary staff. Employers in the Boston, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts said that they were experiencing difficulty in recruiting highly specialized workers. Despite signs of improvement in most labor markets, St. Louis and Minneapolis reported examples of layoffs in the manufacturing sector of their regions.              Input prices rose in most Districts, particularly for cotton and other agricultural commodities, petroleum-based products, and industrial metals. In addition, shippers added fuel surcharges in several Districts. Boston, Cleveland and Atlanta cited increasing cost pressures, and some manufacturers in Boston were raising their selling price to pass costs along to customers. The ability to pass through increases, however, varied in both the Chicago and Atlanta Districts, with manufacturers generally being more successful than retail or construction firms. Contacts in the San Francisco District reported a limited ability to pass through higher input prices on anything other than food and gasoline. Kansas Cited stated that more manufacturers and retailers expected to raise prices in coming months.              Wage pressures were reported to be mostly contained, especially in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Kansas City noted wages generally held steady, even with expanded hiring, and wage pressures were expected to be contained except for highly competitive or specialized positions. Wage pressures were described as modest in the Chicago District. However, Richmond reported slightly faster wage increases. Boston reported that nearly all of the manufacturing firms that they contacted planned to implement merit increases, and one contact planned a greater merit pool next year to compensate for previous low raises. Philadelphia noted some concern about rising nonwage employment costs, but wages for business firms in the District were mostly steady.       Agriculture and Natural Resources        Assessments of agricultural activity were mixed. Varying degrees of drought conditions persisted in the Atlanta, Kansas City and Dallas Districts, with Chicago indicating that some areas in their District did not have adequate subsoil moisture to endure dry spells. In the Kansas City District, agricultural growing conditions generally worsened in late February and March. In particular, winter wheat crop conditions deteriorated further as the drought in the southern Plains intensified. Dallas reported that drought conditions became more widespread in March, covering more than 90 percent of the District. However, Dallas noted that planting was underway despite concern about the lack of soil moisture for spring crops. Chicago also indicated that planting should proceed quickly in most of the District, as fields were in good condition with ground moisture sufficient for an excellent start to the crop year. Moreover, the Minneapolis District continued to enjoy good conditions in spite of wet weather and spring flooding. Most Districts reported that prices of fuel and feed continued to put downward pressure on margins, but prices for most agricultural commodities remained strong. Atlanta said that strong global demand contributed to elevated prices for some farm acreage, while Kansas City attributed higher farmland values to strong crop prices and a limited number of farms for sale.              Activity in the energy industry generally strengthened since the last report. Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas reported increased drilling activity as demand firmed. In the Atlanta District, deep-water drilling permits were issued in late February for the first time since the Gulf oil spill last April, although the number of rigs operating in the Gulf of Mexico was still only about half the number prior to the spill. In the St. Louis and Kansas City Districts, coal production remained above year-ago levels, but was stable to moderately lower in the Cleveland District. Kansas City reported increased drilling activity, with exploration shifting away from natural gas toward crude oil, while Cleveland indicated that oil and gas output held steady. In the San Francisco District, extraction activity for natural gas expanded, while Minneapolis reported that late-March oil exploration activity increased since mid-February. Minneapolis also noted that iron ore mines in northern Minnesota were operating at full capacity, with expectations that 2011 production will be the highest in more than 10 years.",2011-04-13
74,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District    Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and based on information collected on or before May 27, 2011. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.           Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that economic activity generally continued to expand since the last report, though a few Districts indicated some deceleration. Some slowing in the pace of growth was noted in the New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts. In contrast, Dallas characterized that region's economy as accelerating. Other Districts indicated that growth continued at a steady pace. Manufacturing activity continued to expand in most parts of the country, though a number of Districts noted some slowing in the pace of growth. Activity in the non-financial service sectors expanded at a steady pace, led by industries related to information technology and business and professional services.                  Consumer spending was mixed, with most Districts indicating steady to modestly increasing activity. Elevated food and energy prices, as well as unfavorable weather in some parts of the country, were said to be weighing on consumers' propensity to spend. Auto sales were mixed but fairly robust in most of the country, though some slowing was noted in the Northeastern regions. Widespread supply disruptions--primarily related to the disaster in Japan--were reported to have substantially reduced the flow of new automobiles into dealers' inventories, which in turn held down sales in some Districts. Widespread shortages of used cars were also reported to be driving up prices. Tourism activity improved in most Districts.              Residential construction and real estate continued to show widespread weakness, except in the rental segment, where market conditions have strengthened and construction activity and development have picked up. Non-residential real estate leasing markets have been generally stable, while construction activity has remained very subdued. Loan demand was steady to stronger in most Districts, especially in the commercial and industrial sector, and widespread improvement was reported in credit quality.              Agricultural conditions were unfavorable across much of the nation, largely reflecting unseasonably cool and wet weather; widespread flooding along the Mississippi River hampered agricultural production in the Atlanta and St. Louis Districts. In the Dallas District, in contrast, drought conditions hurt the wheat crop and led to broader damage from wildfires. The energy industry showed continued strength, with robust expansion in oil drilling and extraction activity.              Labor market conditions continued to improve gradually across most of the nation, with a number of Districts noting a short supply of workers with specialized technical skills. Wage growth generally remained modest, though there were scattered reports of steeper increases for highly skilled workers in certain occupations. Most Districts continued to report widespread increases in commodity prices; manufacturers are said to be passing along a portion of the higher costs in the form of price hikes and fuel surcharges.       Consumer Spending and Tourism        Consumer spending was generally described as steady to up modestly since the last report, with most Districts indicating small increases from a year ago. Non-auto retail sales were indicated to be expanding steadily in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City and Dallas Districts, while sales were characterized as stable or decelerating in the New York, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis and San Francisco Districts. Sales were reported to have declined in the Richmond District, and Boston described sales as mixed but generally down from a year earlier. Retail inventories were generally said to be at satisfactory levels, though St. Louis characterized inventory levels as being on the high side. A number of Districts noted that a combination of unfavorable weather and high fuel and food prices have weighed on consumer spending in recent weeks. Cleveland and San Francisco noted increased spending on discretionary items, and Philadelphia indicated that some luxury goods retailers fared relatively well. On the other hand, Chicago reported a decline in discretionary spending.              Most Districts reporting on vehicle sales indicated that they have been steady to stronger since the last report, specifically Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco. In addition, Atlanta noted firm demand for automobiles. On the other hand, some softening in car sales was noted in the northeastern Districts of New York, Philadelphia and Cleveland. Many Districts indicated that supply disruptions, primarily from Japan, have contributed to lean inventories, which have impeded auto sales somewhat. There has also been widespread tightening in the market for used cars, reflecting both strong demand and a shortage of inventory. Shifts in consumer demand toward smaller, more fuel efficient cars were noted in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago Districts, while St. Louis mentioned a shift from higher-end to lower-end models.              Tourism activity has generally strengthened since the last report, and the outlook for the summer season looks positive. Improvement in this sector was reported in the Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts; in addition, New York reported that tourism increased in April but appeared to edge back in early May. Dallas maintained that travel activity has been mixed, while Minneapolis indicated that tourism has been slow recently due to adverse weather, but that inquiries and advance bookings for the summer season look strong. St. Louis noted that flooding forced the temporary closure of numerous casinos along the Mississippi River.       Nonfinancial Services        Activity in the non-financial service sectors continued to strengthen in most Districts, with the notable exception of St. Louis, which reported fairly widespread declines. Service sector activity generally expanded in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City and Dallas Districts, though Richmond noted deceleration in the pace of growth. There were also pockets of strength in particular sectors. Information technology firms saw activity expand in the Boston, Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. Employment agencies in the Boston and Chicago Districts indicated continued improvement in activity, while New York and Dallas reported some slowing in this industry. New York, Richmond and Minneapolis cited strengthening in business and professional services, while San Francisco indicated steady to mixed activity in this sector.              Activity in the transportation sector improved in the Cleveland, Atlanta, Kansas City and Dallas Districts. Philadelphia and Richmond noted some slowing in growth, and New York reported steady shipping activity, while San Francisco indicated a slowdown in cargo traffic at Southern California seaports. Dallas also reported weakening in container trade volumes but noted increases in cargo volume, railroad shipments and small parcel shipments.       Manufacturing        Manufacturing activity was reported as continuing to increase since the last report in all but two districts, although many noted that the pace of growth had slowed. The Boston, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco, Districts reported that activity expanded, and the Dallas District reported a pickup in demand; the Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts reported that activity expanded but at a slower pace, while activity was reported as steady in the New York District and stable to growing in the Cleveland District. Supply disruptions related to the earthquake in Japan led to reduced production of automobiles and auto parts in several Districts. The Cleveland District noted a sharp drop in auto production, the Atlanta and St. Louis Districts also saw production fall, and auto deliveries were reported as having declined in the Richmond District. The Atlanta District said lost production in its region would be made up later in the year. Contacts in the Chicago District said that contingency plans to deal with supply disruptions were helpful in mitigating the effects. High-tech firms in the Boston and Dallas Districts reported that shortages of parts, due to disruptions in Japan, had adverse effects on business; in contrast, there were few supply constraints that affected technology-related products in the San Francisco District.              Growth was reported as strong for semiconductors in the San Francisco and Boston Districts. The Cleveland District reported that steel producers were seeing shipping volumes level off after a strong first quarter performance, and the Chicago District noted a decline in second quarter orders for industrial metals, although orders for the third quarter were coming in at a more positive pace. A contact in the Richmond District said that demand for industrial metals had leveled off. The Chicago District reported a decline in activity for construction materials and household goods. Production remained strong for makers of commercial aircraft and parts in the San Francisco District.              Looking forward, contacts in most districts were generally optimistic about the outlook, although less so than the last report. The Cleveland District said that the majority of manufacturing contacts maintained a favorable outlook, although some are delaying the start of capital projects. Contacts were generally cautiously optimistic in the Boston District, although some expect sales growth to moderate. Contacts were mostly positive about the outlook in the Philadelphia District, though the level of optimism was not quite as strong as in the last report. Chicago District contacts expect conditions to rebound in the coming months. A majority of contacts in the Atlanta District planned to increase production.       Real Estate and Construction        Residential real estate sales markets showed continued weakness in most Districts, while rental markets strengthened. Most Districts indicate that home prices have declined since the last report: Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco all report some downward drift in selling prices, while reports from the New York and Cleveland Districts indicate that prices have been steady, on balance. No district indicates a general increase in home prices. Sales activity, though widely reported to be at low levels, picked up somewhat in the Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts. Dallas indicated that improved traffic has raised prospects of improved sales in the second half of 2011, and Boston observed signs that the market is stabilizing. Sales activity was characterized as mostly steady in the New York, Cleveland, Dallas and San Francisco Districts, but declining in the St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts. Those Districts reporting on the residential rental market--specifically, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco--all indicate that conditions have strengthened. In terms of residential construction, activity has remained generally depressed, with a number of Districts reporting a large overhang of distressed properties. However, a number of Districts--New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco--report improved prospects for development of multi-family rental properties.              Commercial and industrial real estate markets have generally been steady since the last report, though there have been scattered signs of a pickup. Commercial leasing markets showed modest signs of improvement in the Richmond and San Francisco Districts. Boston and Dallas noted some firming in property sales markets, but Kansas City reported declines in prices for office buildings. Non-residential construction, though widely reported to be at very low levels, rose modestly in the Boston, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts, though Chicago noted that public sector projects are becoming smaller. Cleveland observed a pickup in industrial and high-end commercial development but a pullback in healthcare-related projects. Richmond reported some pockets of strength in the retail market. More broadly, contacts in a number of Districts expressed a general sense of optimism about the outlook for the second half of 2011.       Banking and Finance        Most Districts described loan demand as mixed or slightly improved since the last report. Consumer loan demand showed some improvement in the Cleveland, Richmond, and St. Louis Districts, but held steady or weakened in the New York, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Demand for residential mortgages (including new purchases and refinances) increased in Cleveland but held steady in New York, Richmond, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Contacts in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts noted a modest uptick in business loan demand. The increase in business loan demand in Cleveland was described as broad-based, including a pickup in construction loan requests for multi-family dwellings. Boston noted an improved lending environment for commercial real estate, and demand for commercial mortgages increased in New York and Dallas. Commercial and industrial loan activity increased in Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco, held steady in New York, and decreased in Kansas City. Outside of banking, Chicago and San Francisco indicated increased investment activity by hedge funds, venture capital firms, and other forms of private equity.              Credit standards were reported to be mixed but, on balance, a bit easier in recent weeks. New York, Cleveland, and Atlanta noted increased credit availability for automobile loans; Atlanta, Minneapolis and San Francisco indicated easier credit for some types of business loans. Boston reported some easing in commercial real estate lending, but New York reported tighter standards in that segment. Credit standards on home mortgage loans tightened somewhat in the St. Louis District. A number of Districts noted improvements in overall credit quality: specifically, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. New York indicated rising delinquency rates on consumer loans but declining rates on commercial loans and mortgages.       Agriculture and Natural Resources        Agriculture conditions were unfavorable in many districts, with various weather related difficulties leading to delays and below-average plantings of key crops. Excess precipitation and cool temperatures delayed the planting of corn, soybeans, and other crops in the Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts, although Richmond reported that some parts of its District benefited from favorable weather conditions. Cool temperatures also delayed the development of some crops in the San Francisco District. Flooding on the Mississippi River slowed activity for farmers in the St. Louis and Atlanta Districts. The Dallas District reported that drought conditions had become severe and that the wheat crop was expected to be particularly poor; wildfires also led to significant agricultural losses in its District. Commodity prices were reported as strong in the Atlanta and Minneapolis Districts, but were down in the Chicago District. Hog prices were higher in the Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts, while cattle prices were reported as lower in the Chicago and Kansas City Districts but higher in the Minneapolis and Atlanta Districts.              Activity in the energy industry remained robust. Drilling activity was reported as strong and growing in the Dallas District, and work is being re-permitted in the Gulf of Mexico. The San Francisco District reported that oil extraction activity grew strongly in response to rising demand overseas, and that the demand for natural gas continued to expand. In the Minneapolis District, oil exploration activity increased. Contacts reported an increase in drilling activity in the Kansas City District, although shortages of equipment and labor created some drilling constraints. The St. Louis District reported that coal production was modestly lower.       Employment, Wages, and Prices        Most Districts reported gradual improvement in labor market conditions since their last reports. Boston, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas all noted general improvement in employment conditions, while job growth was mostly limited to the manufacturing sector in the Cleveland and St. Louis Districts. Demand for permanent and temporary-to-permanent hiring increased in the Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts. While labor was generally available, contacts in the Boston, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts indicated that labor market conditions have tightened for workers with specialized technical skills, particularly in the healthcare and technology sectors. Despite signs of continued modest improvement in most labor markets, Minneapolis noted several examples of expected layoffs and St. Louis reported plans for layoffs in the District's services sector.              Wage pressures were reported to be largely contained in most Districts, as abundant labor availability has continued to limit the pace of wage growth. Modest wage pressures were reported in the Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, while wages were reported as steady in New York and Philadelphia. However, contacts in the Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts noted that wage increases have been more significant for some highly skilled workers in occupations with labor shortages. Firms' expectations for labor and benefits costs moderated slightly in Atlanta.              Input prices continued to increase in most Districts, particularly for agricultural commodities, petroleum-based products, and industrial metals, although the pace of growth slowed in the Chicago and Kansas City Districts. In addition, several Districts reported that fuel surcharges have increased or become more widely used since the last report. While Boston indicated that firms were able to pass along most input price increases into selling prices, contacts in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco noted only a limited ability to pass through these cost increases to their customers, with manufacturers generally being more successful than retail or construction firms. In general, selling prices increased only modestly, except for food and energy prices, which continued to escalate. In addition, low inventory levels contributed to price increases for used cars in the New York, Cleveland, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts. Plans to implement future increases in selling prices were reported in the Boston, New York, Chicago, and Dallas Districts.",2011-06-08
75,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District    Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and based on information collected on or before July 15, 2011. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.           Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that economic activity continued to grow; however, the pace has moderated in many Districts. The six Districts nearest the Atlantic seaboard reported a slowdown in activity since the previous Beige Book report; activity was little changed in the Atlanta District and unchanged or slightly improved in the Richmond District. Of the other six Districts, the Minneapolis District reported political and weather-related disruptions that temporarily slowed growth, and the Dallas District slowed to a moderate pace of growth. The remaining four Districts continued to grow modestly. The previous Beige Book reported a slower growth rate for four Districts, seven Districts growing at a steady pace, and one District with faster growth.                  Consumer spending increased overall, with modest growth of nonauto retail sales in a majority of Districts. Falling gasoline prices throughout most of this reporting period may have encouraged a pickup in shopping trips and some additional spending since the previous Beige Book. Price pressures from food, energy, cotton, and other supplier inputs continued to squeeze retail margins. Auto sales slowed a little since the previous Beige Book, with inventories still lean due to Japanese supply chain disruptions. The summer tourism season has started off stronger than last year in most areas unaffected by severe weather.              Activity among nonfinancial service sectors improved overall in most Districts. Of the five Districts reporting on transportation services, volumes were mostly up. Manufacturing activity expanded overall, with two Districts growing at a somewhat faster rate since the last Beige Book, many Districts reporting steady or slowing growth, and two Districts reporting little change. Among firms reporting on near-term expectations, the manufacturing outlook remained generally optimistic, but capital spending plans were somewhat more cautious.              Most residential real estate activity was little changed and remained weak, although construction and activity in the residential rental market continued to improve since the previous Beige Book. For six Districts, activity in the nonresidential real estate market has improved slightly for specific submarkets, although conditions generally remained weak across all twelve Districts. Since the last Beige Book, overall loan volumes have increased in three Districts, decreased in two Districts, and were relatively flat, often with mixed trends across the banks' portfolios, in five Districts. Credit quality was steady or improving.              Drought conditions and severe flooding adversely affected large portions of the seven Districts that reported on their agricultural sectors. Districts that reported on their energy and mining sectors continued to note strong growth for most energy-related products but some weakness in coal production.              Although most Federal Reserve Districts observed modest hiring increases, labor market conditions remained soft. Wage pressures continued to be subdued for all but a few specific occupations in some Districts. Price pressures moderated somewhat in many Districts, although some firms indicated that they were able to pass on some cost increases to their customers.       Consumer Spending and Tourism        Consumer spending increased overall in most Districts since the last Beige Book. The New York, Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts indicated modest growth of nonauto retail sales, and the Philadelphia and Kansas City Districts noted relatively strong growth. Retailers in the Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts reported mixed results across product lines, while St. Louis District retailers reported slowing sales. Stronger sales in some New York City stores were attributed to tourism, while one large mall in western New York credited Canadian shoppers as the source. A major Philadelphia District retailer suggested that increased shopping trips and a greater willingness to spend were due to lower gas prices since the last Beige Book. Inventory levels were not a strong concern. Contacts from half of the Districts noted upward pressure from supplier prices--cotton was often mentioned--and other non-labor inputs, especially food and energy. Some retailers were able to pass through some cost increases, but for many, especially restaurants, profit margins were squeezed. Restaurant contacts in the Atlanta and Kansas City Districts still managed to report strong sales.              Reports of auto sales were mixed across Districts and varied by vehicle make, with most Districts indicating that dealer inventories were lean primarily due to lingering supply disruptions for Japanese vehicles and parts. Auto dealers in the Kansas City District cited strong sales despite reduced incentives and credited, in part, continued low interest rates and tornado damage. The Chicago District noted lower sales in June as incentives decreased and showroom traffic declined, followed by improved sales in early July. The New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts noted varying degrees of lower sales stemming from Japanese supply constraints. Strong demand for smaller vehicles and used cars continued in several Districts. The Cleveland District described dealers' outlook as cautious due to uncertainty about gas prices, the economy, and vehicle availability.              Tourism activity strengthened in most Districts as the summer season got underway. The Richmond District reported that bookings along the Mid-Atlantic coast were comparable to the 2010 season, despite last year's increase from additional vacationers who were avoiding the Gulf Coast oil spill. The New York, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts also reported increased tourism. Tourism was also up in parts of the Kansas and Minneapolis Districts, except for destinations adversely affected by drought, heavy rains, flooding, and Minnesota's state government shutdown.       Nonfinancial Services        Growth of nonfinancial services advanced further during this Beige Book period for the Districts overall. The Boston, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported the strongest advances. The Philadelphia and Richmond Districts reported slight improvements, while activity in the New York District flattened. Respondents remained optimistic about growth over the next three to six months in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts. However, the New York District's contacts were less optimistic than they were when polled for the previous Beige Book. High-tech firms in the Kansas City District expressed an optimistic outlook and planned to increase capital spending.              Among the five Districts that reported on transportation services, freight transport shipping volumes in the Cleveland District, port activity in the Richmond District, and intermodal cargo volumes in the Dallas District expanded somewhat. The Kansas City District also reported increased activity, while Atlanta District firms indicated that their domestic volumes of freight and parcels were slowing somewhat.                      Manufacturing        Manufacturing activity expanded overall, with two Districts reporting somewhat stronger growth since the last Beige Book, many Districts reporting steady or slowing in growth, and two Districts reporting little change. Auto production in the Cleveland District rose moderately, as supply disruptions caused by events in Japan diminished. The Kansas City District also reported a rebound in manufacturing activity from a low level in the prior survey period, while activity at high-tech firms expanded further. Foreign demand for metal fabrication and overall demand for semiconductors and other technology products contributed to slightly faster growth rates in the San Francisco District. Manufacturers in the Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Districts reported continued growth at a relatively steady pace from the previous reporting period. The Chicago District cited a rebound in auto production and strong demand for heavy trucks and equipment.              Growth continued among manufacturers in the Boston and Dallas Districts as well; however, results were more mixed. Contacts in the Boston District cited stronger growth for products related to foreign demand, non-luxury consumer goods, and clients addressing deferred maintenance needs. Softer growth was reported by firms delivering consumer luxury goods, and products or services to the small business, banking, and government sectors.              Manufacturing firms in the Philadelphia, Richmond, and Atlanta Districts reported somewhat slower rates of growth overall. However, the Philadelphia District reported a lull early in the period, followed by resumption of a slow rate of growth in early July, while the Richmond District reported moderate gains, which stalled in early July. Manufacturing firms in the New York District reported a pause in growth throughout the period.              Manufacturing firms' expectations of future activity were optimistic in the Boston and Philadelphia Districts, although Boston's firms were less positive than in the previous Beige Book, and Philadelphia's firms were more positive. Firms in the Boston District indicated limited plans for capital spending, while firms in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas Districts maintained plans for capital spending at prior levels. Fewer firms in the Cleveland District were reporting delays to project starts for their capital spending plans.       Real Estate and Construction        Residential real estate sales in almost all Districts were little changed from the last Beige Book. Activity edged up in the Richmond, Atlanta, and Minneapolis Districts. Of the Districts reporting on home prices, most said that they were flat or declining. The Boston and Richmond Districts reported steady prices; the Philadelphia and Atlanta Districts reported that prices were steady to down slightly; and the Kansas City and New York Districts reported that prices were down. Increasing inventories of unsold homes in the Boston, New York, and Kansas City Districts have restrained building in the single-family housing sector. Residential construction activity overall was mixed, though it increased in the Minneapolis District. Since the previous Beige Book, construction and activity in the residential rental market have continued to improve in the New York, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts.              Nonresidential real estate activity improved somewhat in the Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas Districts. The Chicago District reported strong demand for industrial facilities, particularly from the automotive sector. The Philadelphia District reported improvements in terms of lower vacancy rates for office space, industrial space, and apartments; the Chicago District reported generally lower vacancy rates. The New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts all reported generally weak activity in nonresidential real estate. Construction in the Minneapolis District stalled in areas because of flooding and unavailability of state building inspectors due to the Minnesota state government shutdown. Health care and apartment construction was a bright spot for the Atlanta District. Activity was weak in the Kansas City District, but firms that supply construction materials reported increased sales and stable prices. San Francisco reported stable but high vacancy rates in many parts of the District.       Banking and Finance        Reports of loan demand were more mixed than in the previous Beige Book. The New York, Richmond, and Chicago Districts reported overall increases in loan demand but from different sources. Commercial and industrial loans accounted for the growth in the New York District, while consumer loans accounted for the growth in the Chicago District. Loan growth in the Richmond District was driven by consumer lending, real estate loans for apartments, and commercial loans for larger companies. Total loan volume decreased in the St. Louis and Kansas City Districts, reflecting decreases in real estate lending and individual loans in St. Louis and reductions in consumer installment, commercial real estate, and commercial and industrial loans in Kansas City. The Philadelphia, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported relatively little overall change in loan volume, while the Cleveland and Atlanta Districts reported mixed results. Outside of banking, the San Francisco District indicated increased investment activity by venture capital firms and higher levels of IPO activity.              Credit conditions have changed little since the previous Beige Book. Banks in the New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas Districts reported that credit quality was flat or somewhat improved. Bankers in the Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts noted that competition among lenders for high-quality borrowers was squeezing banks' margins and lowering the cost of capital for those borrowers. Bank contacts in the New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts indicated that credit standards were mostly unchanged at tight levels, but the Cleveland District heard a few reports of easing standards for good borrowers.       Agriculture and Natural Resources        Severe drought conditions adversely affected parts of the Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, causing low crop yields, complete crop losses, wildfires, and loss of grazing land in many areas. The Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported that ranchers had culled herds or placed cattle on feed lots in response to poor pasture conditions, despite higher feed lot costs that trim their margins. Meanwhile, the Chicago and Minneapolis Districts noted that flooding had caused millions of acres to go unplanted. The Atlanta District reported that rain brought relief to some stressed pastures and crops, but farm labor shortages had impaired Georgia's fruit and vegetable production. The St. Louis District reported fair or better conditions for corn, soybean, sorghum, rice, and cotton crops, plus an increase from 2010 in its winter wheat production. Kansas City reported good or better conditions for corn and soybean crops. Agricultural prices were mixed since the last report, with the Chicago and Minneapolis Districts reporting lower cattle and wheat prices, while soybean and dairy prices were up. Chicago also reported higher prices for hogs.              Activity in the energy sector remained strong. Shale exploration increased in the Atlanta and Cleveland Districts. The Cleveland District also reported little change in the production of oil, natural gas, or coal, despite rising demand for coal. The St. Louis District reported higher coal production than the prior year. The Minneapolis District reported continued strong mining activity and mixed plans for wind farms and biodiesel. The Kansas City District reported expanded drilling activity and higher ethanol production but weak coal production. The Dallas District also reported strong drilling activity, and the San Francisco District reported strong activity for metal mining, along with oil and gas extraction.       Employment, Wages, and Prices        Labor market conditions remained soft in most Federal Reserve Districts. Employment, especially among temporary hiring agencies, improved in the Richmond District in recent weeks. Modest hiring increases, often within specific sectors such as advertising in the Boston District and manufacturing in the Cleveland District, contributed to modest overall employment gains. Small gains were also noted in the St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts. The New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago Districts reported a slowdown in the pace of hiring activity. A staffing firm in the Chicago District reported a decline in billable hours.              Wage pressures remained subdued in most Districts and for most occupations. For the overall labor market, the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported limited wage pressures. Wage pressures or wage increases were characterized as modest or moderate by the Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts. Boston District contacts reported wage growth between 3 percent and 5 percent in consulting and advertising. In addition, contacts in the Kansas City District reported labor shortages and wage pressures in the retail sector and for many occupations in the high-tech, energy, and transportation sectors, while the San Francisco District reported continued wage pressures for specialized information technology workers.              Price pressures seemed to have moderated somewhat, although some firms reported being able to pass on some rising costs. Overall, input price pressures appeared to have fallen modestly. Input price increases remained elevated in the Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts. Meanwhile, the Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts reported moderation in input price pressures relative to the previous Beige Book. For the most part, firms' ability to pass on price increases remained mixed. A few Districts reported some sectors being able to pass on rising prices, such as the retail sector in the Chicago District and service-sector firms in the Dallas District.",2011-07-27
76,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District    Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and based on information collected on or before August 26, 2011. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.           Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that economic activity continued to expand at a modest pace, though some Districts noted mixed or weakening activity. The St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts all reported either modest or slight expansion. Atlanta said activity continued to expand at a very subdued pace, while Cleveland reported slow growth and New York indicated growth remained sluggish. Economic activity expanded more slowly in the Chicago District and slowed in the Richmond District. Business activity in the Boston and Philadelphia Districts was characterized as mixed, with Philadelphia adding that activity was somewhat weaker overall. Several Districts also indicated that recent stock market volatility and increased economic uncertainty had led many contacts to downgrade or become more cautious about their near-term outlooks.                  Consumer spending increased slightly in most Districts since the last survey, but non-auto retail sales were flat or down in several Districts. Although poor weather dampened growth in some areas, tourist activity remained solid in most Districts. The demand for services was generally positive throughout the nation, but one region said conditions were deteriorating. Of the five Districts reporting on transportation, three said conditions were mostly positive, while the other two reported activity as flat or slightly below expectations. Manufacturing conditions were mixed across the country, but the pace of activity slowed in many Districts. Residential real estate markets remained weak overall with only a few slight improvements in some Districts. Most Districts characterized commercial real estate and construction activity as weak or little changed, but improvements were noted in several areas. Loan demand remained stable or slightly weaker, and lending standards were largely unchanged with an improvement in loan quality. Harsh summer weather negatively affected agricultural activity, although recent rains in several Districts provided some relief. Districts reporting on energy activity said it generally expanded, with further growth expected.              Price pressures edged lower, although input costs continued to increase in some industries and retail prices rose in several Districts. Labor markets were generally stable, although some Districts reported modest employment growth. Wage pressures were generally minimal outside of some upward movement for skilled positions.       Consumer Spending and Tourism        Overall consumer spending increased slightly in most Districts, but non-auto retail sales were flat or down in some Districts. Hurricane Irene evacuations also produced widespread retail disruptions in late August in the New York District, where activity had been close to or above plan in July before slowing somewhat in early August. The Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts reported moderate increases in non-auto retail sales during the survey period, and sales in the San Francisco District were mixed but up slightly overall. Retail sales were up single-digits from a year ago in the Cleveland and Dallas Districts, although Dallas reported no growth in sales since the previous survey period. Retailers in the Chicago District reported strong back to school sales, while Atlanta said growth slowed in retail sales. The Boston and Philadelphia Districts said sales were flat to down but with sizable variation across stores, while sales mostly weakened in the Richmond and St. Louis Districts. Sales of apparel and luxury items were characterized as strong in several Districts. The Boston, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts all noted sluggish sales of big ticket household items such as furniture and appliances, and contacts in several Districts thought that heightened consumer anxiety was weighing on sales. Contacts in some Districts continued to indicate profit margins were being squeezed by rising input costs, although grocers in the Cleveland District were passing cost increases through to customers.              Most Districts reporting on auto sales noted increases in activity, despite lingering supply disruptions for some Japanese nameplates. The Kansas City and Cleveland Districts reported especially strong sales of fuel-efficient cars, while luxury vehicles sold well in the Minneapolis District. High demand for used cars was reported in several Districts. The New York and Philadelphia Districts reported somewhat softer auto sales in July, attributed in part to continued supply disruptions, although sales firmed somewhat in August. Tight vehicle supplies were noted in some Districts, and the San Francisco District noted ongoing shortages of Japanese nameplates. Auto contacts in the Dallas District believed the supply issues from Japanese manufacturers should be resolved by the end of September. Auto dealers in several Districts were optimistic about future sales, although contacts in the Philadelphia District said uncertainty clouded the outlook. The Cleveland District noted some easing in auto credit restrictions, and New York said both retail and wholesale auto credit conditions were good.              Tourism activity remained solid in most Districts, although poor weather affected growth in some areas. Travel activity was reported as robust in the Atlanta District, especially for airport traffic in South Florida. Tourism in the New York City area was also very strong prior to Hurricane Irene, and city theaters planned to re-open the Monday morning after the hurricane. Both business and leisure travel posted further improvement in the San Francisco District, and tourism activity was solid overall in the Minneapolis District despite heavy rains in Montana. By contrast, tourism activity slowed in July in the Boston District, leading hotels to increase promotional offerings, and the Long Island and Jersey Shore areas of the New York District as well as coastal areas of the Richmond District were heavily affected by hurricane evacuations in late August. Hotels in several Districts were raising room rates, although the Kansas City District noted some easing.       Nonfinancial Services        Nonfinancial services activity edged higher in most Districts, although Minneapolis and Dallas characterized growth as flat or steady, and New York said conditions deteriorated. Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco reported generally solid demand for health-care services, although Richmond noted lower occupancies at senior care facilities due to difficulties among potential residents in selling their homes. Software and information technology firms in the Boston District reported mixed activity since July but expected to return to previous strong growth patterns by late 2011. The San Francisco District reported expanded sales for technology service providers due to heightened demand for software, e-books, and mobile applications. In contrast, an information technology contact in the Minneapolis District noted a decline in sales as a result of reduced demand from the government and financial services sectors.              In transportation services, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Dallas reported mostly positive conditions, while activity was flat in the San Francisco District and below expectations in the Kansas City District. Railroad shipments rose slightly in the Dallas District, with particularly strong volume growth in metallic ores, petroleum products, and non-commercial building products. Cleveland noted an acceleration in capital spending, mainly to replace aging equipment and support demand growth from energy customers. Trucking firms in the Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts reported a shortage of qualified drivers, and a few firms noted concerns about higher fuel costs. Many services contacts expressed substantial uncertainty about future business activity, with a few Districts reporting weakened outlooks for transportation.       Manufacturing        Manufacturing conditions were mixed across the country, but the pace of activity slowed in many Districts. The New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond Districts reported declining activity overall, and contacts in the Boston and Dallas Districts noted slowing demand from European customers. Cleveland said factory production was stable, and manufacturing activity in the Atlanta and Chicago Districts grew at a slower pace. Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported slight expansions, and St. Louis said activity continued to increase and that several manufacturers planned to open plants and expand operations in the near future. Most manufacturing contacts were less optimistic than in the previous survey; however, future capital spending plans were solid in a few Districts.              Looking across factory sectors, auto production decreased in the Cleveland District due to normal seasonal retooling for model changeovers, and the Chicago District said auto production leveled off in August after a strong July. Textile manufacturers in the Richmond District said markets have grown weaker due to declining consumer confidence. Construction-related manufacturing was characterized as weak in the Dallas and Philadelphia Districts, and Boston noted a cyclical decline in semiconductor demand. Philadelphia reported a decline in food manufacturing, and the Kansas City District noted weakness at nondurable goods plants. In contrast, commercial aircraft manufacturers in the San Francisco District reported solid production rates due to new orders for narrow-body aircraft and a growing order backlog. A metal fabricator in the Minneapolis District announced plans to expand a facility in northwestern Montana. Capacity utilization in the steel industry remained at record high levels in the Chicago District, and a tire manufacturer in the Atlanta District noted particular pressure in meeting a recent surge in new orders due to supply chain normalization after the Japan disaster.       Real Estate and Construction        Residential real estate activity remained weak overall, although a few Districts noted some slight improvements. Contacts in the Boston, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts reported an increase in home sales over the previous year's weak levels; however, the uptick in the Atlanta District was concentrated mainly in Florida. The remaining Districts all reported stable or slower sales from the previous survey period, with several citing greater economic uncertainty as the primary cause. Both the New York and Philadelphia Districts reported that a growing backlog of foreclosures in New Jersey continued to weigh down the housing market. Home construction was down or stagnant in most Districts, with the exception of Minneapolis and Kansas City. However, several Districts indicated an improvement in home remodeling activity, and the New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland Districts reported increased demand for multi-family housing projects. Home prices were flat to slightly down in several Districts, although New York said prices in many areas edged higher but remained below year-ago levels. Contacts in the Boston District reported competitive pricing by sellers with even lower prices negotiated by buyers, but in the Cleveland District many builders have shifted away from discounting. Inventories were elevated or rising in the Boston, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts, particularly for existing homes, and demand for apartment rental space increased in the San Francisco and Dallas Districts.              Commercial real estate conditions remained weak or little changed in most Districts, although some improvements were noted by New York, Minneapolis, and Dallas. Commercial real estate activity was sluggish in the Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. However, San Francisco noted some areas have benefited from technology sector growth, and Boston noted investor demand for prime office buildings remained strong. New York said office vacancy rates declined noticeably in the Buffalo and Rochester metro areas and modestly in Manhattan and Long Island. Lower commercial rents helped push down vacancy rates in the Kansas City District, and the Dallas District noted strong demand for leased space in Houston due to solid energy activity. Commercial construction was characterized as weak or limited by Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City, although Atlanta noted some strength in the healthcare sector. St. Louis described conditions as mixed, with some improvement in education and energy-related construction, while Minneapolis District contacts reported an increase in small retrofitting projects and rebuilding in flood-damaged areas. The Chicago District noted continued strength in industrial construction, particularly in the automotive sector. Credit for commercial development remained an obstacle for small retailers in the Richmond District, although Boston said aggressive competition among lenders led to reduced borrowing rates.       Banking and Finance        Most districts cited overall loan demand as stable to slightly weaker, with the exception of St. Louis, which reported a modest increase. Demand for business loans remained unchanged or weakened in the New York, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, but was moderately stronger in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and St. Louis Districts. Demand for consumer loans increased somewhat in the St. Louis District, but was unchanged to slightly weaker in the New York, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. While Kansas City reported a decline in commercial real estate loans, St. Louis cited a modest increase. New York and Cleveland noted increased demand for residential mortgages.              Most Districts said that loan quality was generally improving and that credit standards were largely unchanged. Cleveland reported a decline in delinquencies across all loan categories, and Richmond and Kansas City also indicated a continued strengthening in loan quality. However, New York indicated that delinquency rates increased on most categories of loans and that banks tightened standards for commercial mortgages and commercial and industrial loans. Banking contacts in several Districts also referenced concerns about the economy. The Chicago District cited recent volatility in financial markets and reduced expectations for economic growth, while Kansas City District contacts listed a weak economic recovery and uncertainty about financial regulations.       Agriculture and Natural Resources        Harsh summer weather strained agricultural activity in many Districts since the last survey period. Hot, dry weather stressed crops and livestock in the Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts, with poor pasture conditions hastening herd liquidations in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts. Recent rains provided some relief to agricultural producers in the Richmond and Atlanta Districts, but Hurricane Irene caused extensive damage to field crops not yet harvested in North Carolina. Shrinking production estimates pushed up crop prices and the Chicago District noted that robust ethanol production was also driving corn prices higher. Crop and livestock sales rose in the San Francisco District, and the Dallas District reported strong beef exports. Farmland values rose further in the Chicago and Kansas City Districts, but rising input costs trimmed farm capital spending in the Kansas City District.              Energy activity generally expanded since the last survey period, with additional gains expected in coming months. The Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts reported an increase in land-based oil drilling activity, and the Atlanta and Dallas Districts reported a modest rise in off-shore drilling operations in the Gulf of Mexico. Natural gas exploration rose in the Cleveland District, and remained steady in the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts. Additional capital investments in oil and gas production were expected in the Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts. Energy contacts in the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts noted some new hiring, although permit delays and environmental compliance could constrain expansion. Coal production rose in the Kansas City District, held steady in the Cleveland District, and fell in the St. Louis District. Higher metals prices spurred mining activity in the Minneapolis and San Francisco Districts, especially for iron ore.       Employment, Wages, and Prices        Labor markets were generally steady, although some Districts reported modest employment growth. Several Districts reported a shortage of skilled workers such as engineers, mechanics, and software developers. Jobs in the health care industry continued to increase, and the Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts indicated growth in energy-related employment. Many Districts reported an increase in auto sales and service technician positions, and several companies in the Minneapolis District announced new manufacturing jobs. The Atlanta District noted that many contacts were focused on productivity and efficiency increases with existing staff, and Richmond said one firm would rather pay overtime than hire new workers. A large staffing firm in Chicago reported a decline in billable hours for staffing and professional services as well as fewer permanent placements, while Boston said demand for permanent and temporary-to-permanent hiring continued to grow. A major New York City employment agency reported unusually slow hiring activity in August but remained cautiously optimistic about future recruitment. Most Districts reported that wage pressures were minimal, but contacts noted some wage gains for several skilled positions as a result of heightened demand.              The majority of Districts reported fewer price pressures, but input costs continued to rise in select industries. The New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and San Francisco Districts noted some stabilization or decline in raw materials prices but Chicago said elevated commodity prices continued to put pressure on costs, particularly copper and steel. Manufacturers in the Boston District were able to pass through input price increases with little resistance, although a semiconductor firm was one exception. The Kansas City District reported construction materials prices as steady, excluding prices of petroleum-based products such as roofing shingles and asphalt, which continued to rise. Retail prices were steady or rising slightly in New York, Richmond, and Atlanta, although some Atlanta District retailers mentioned that weak sales could prompt them to lower prices. Retailers in the Dallas District noted a slight decline in overall prices, although increases were observed in certain high-end goods and cotton-based products. Prices for cotton-based products, such as clothing, also increased in the San Francisco and Cleveland Districts. Food prices climbed higher in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts, and restaurants in the Kansas City District expected further increases in menu prices as a result of rising food costs.",2011-09-07
77,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District    Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and based on information collected on or before October 7, 2011. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.            Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that overall economic activity continued to expand in September, although many Districts described the pace of growth as ""modest"" or ""slight"" and contacts generally noted weaker or less certain outlooks for business conditions. The reports suggest that consumer spending was up slightly in most Districts, with auto sales and tourism leading the way in several of them. Business spending increased somewhat, particularly for construction and mining equipment and auto dealer inventories, but many Districts noted restraint in hiring and capital spending plans. By sector, manufacturing and transportation activity was reported to have increased on balance. A few Districts also reported slight improvements in construction and real estate activity; nonetheless, overall conditions for both residential and commercial real estate remained weak. Districts reporting on nonfinancial services cited mixed results with activity varying widely by industry. Loan demand by and large moved lower, with the exception of an increase in mortgage refinancing in many Districts. Crop conditions at harvest were generally less favorable than a year ago. In contrast, energy and mining activity continued to strengthen in several Districts, with the exception of some storm-related slowdowns in the Gulf of Mexico. Cost pressures eased in the majority of Districts, though there was some further pass-through of earlier increases to downstream prices. Wage pressures remained subdued outside of a few exceptions in which firms noted having difficulty finding appropriately skilled workers.            Consumer Spending and Tourism        Consumer spending was up slightly in September. The majority of Districts reported increases in auto sales, with the largest improvements in San Francisco and New York. Several Districts noted a greater availability of new vehicles as the supply disruptions that had plagued auto dealerships in the aftermath of the Japanese disaster subsided. Contacts in the Cleveland, New York, Philadelphia, and Dallas Districts indicated that demand for used cars remained high and that some models were still scarce. A large number of Districts reported that non-auto retail sales were flat to down in September; but a few, such as Philadelphia, Richmond, and Dallas noted an increase in customer traffic late in the month and into early October. Back-to-school sales were described as being fairly strong in New York and satisfactory in Richmond. In addition, Boston, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas cited some strength in the sales of big-ticket or luxury items, while Minneapolis and Chicago noted that more consumers were trading down to value products at grocery stores.              Tourism was generally higher in those Districts reporting on the sector. Contacts in New York noted that, despite the negative impact of Hurricane Irene, Broadway and hotel revenues continued to rise. Richmond reported substantial damage from Hurricane Irene to some tourist destinations that were subsequently forced to close for repairs, but tourism remained vibrant in other areas. Boston, Atlanta, and Minneapolis also cited increases in tourism, with hospitality contacts in Atlanta expecting a robust holiday season. Tourism results were mixed across various destinations in the San Francisco district.       Business Spending        Business spending increased somewhat from the previous report. However, contacts in a number of Districts reported that a weaker and more uncertain economic outlook had increased caution and was weighing on future spending plans. Philadelphia, Richmond, and Chicago indicated that many retailers were reluctant to build inventories ahead of the holiday season, pointing to recent declines in consumer confidence. Auto dealers were an exception, as they continued to replenish inventories that ran low in the aftermath of the production disruptions caused by the Japanese disaster. Capital spending continued as planned in most Districts. Respondents in Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago noted increased purchases of equipment in the manufacturing, mining, and transportation industries. Boston and Minneapolis indicated that some manufacturers planned to expand capacity either through mergers and acquisitions or the building of additional facilities. Atlanta cited a pick-up in corporate expansion and relocation interest, and Chicago noted an increase in mergers and acquisitions activity among middle-market firms.       Nonfinancial Services        Reports regarding nonfinancial services were mixed in September. Richmond noted slower overall activity, and St. Louis cited reduced demand for telecommunications, media, and education services. Demand for accounting and legal services was reported to have been unchanged in both Dallas and San Francisco. On the positive side, contacts in St. Louis reported that demand for business support services increased, and Boston reported strong business conditions for economic consulting firms involved with litigation work and advertising firms helping to market financial services. In addition, San Francisco noted continued growth in demand for technology services, Minneapolis noted an increase in activity in software and engineering, and Philadelphia cited some growth in logistics. Staffing at nonfinancial service-sector firms was reported to have been up slightly in Richmond, but growth slowed in Chicago and Philadelphia reported flat activity.       Manufacturing and Transportation        Contacts indicated that manufacturing and transportation activity increased since the last report in most Districts. A large number of Districts reported higher production of autos and other transportation-related equipment. Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago noted increases in auto production, and Boston, Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis all cited robust activity for auto suppliers. Dallas reported healthy demand for nondefense transportation goods. Boston, Richmond, Kansas City, and San Francisco indicated continued growth in commercial aviation and aerospace manufacturing. Steel production rose in Cleveland and Chicago, and in a number of Districts metal manufacturers' new orders also rose. Other areas of manufacturing were more mixed. The Dallas report noted a decline in refining activity. However, both Dallas and Atlanta continued to note robust oil and gas drilling activity, and this activity was said to be propelling demand for related equipment from suppliers in Chicago. Manufacturing of construction materials or equipment was reported to have increased some in Philadelphia, Chicago, and Dallas but remained weak in most other Districts. Growth in high-tech manufacturing continued to be robust in Boston, but moderated in Dallas and San Francisco. Respondents reported that food production was up in Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco, steady in Dallas, and lower in Boston. Manufacturers of consumer products reported a softening in orders in Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas, while new orders for apparel increased in San Francisco. Freight traffic increased in Cleveland and Atlanta, driven in large part by shipments of commodities, and Richmond also noted that port activity for commodities continued to be robust. However, Richmond also indicated that imports and exports, in particular of consumer goods, were both somewhat soft during what is typically the peak season for trade.       Real Estate and Construction        All twelve Districts reported that real estate and construction activity was little changed on balance from the prior report. Residential construction remained at low levels, particularly for single-family homes. That said, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Minneapolis noted small increases in single-family construction, and construction of multifamily dwellings continued to increase at a moderate pace in Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Home sales remained weak overall, and home prices were reported to be either flat or declining across all of the Districts. In contrast, rental demand continued to rise in a number of Districts. Commercial real estate conditions remained weak overall, although commercial construction increased at a slow pace in most Districts. Boston, Philadelphia, St. Louis and Cleveland cited some gains in demand for construction of education, healthcare, and institutional-related buildings, and New York reported an increase in hotel development. Furthermore, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago noted an increase in demand for manufacturing and distribution facilities. Vacancy rates remained elevated, but Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis and Dallas reported an increase in leasing activity and Philadelphia and San Francisco indicated rising investor interest in well-leased office space.       Banking and Finance        Financial activity was reported to have weakened some since the last report. Dallas noted that the improvement in financial conditions had stalled, and Chicago indicated a further tightening of credit conditions, particularly for financial firms. In addition, New York reported noticeably weaker activity in the securities industry. Loan volumes were either flat or down slightly in most Districts. Consumer loan demand moved lower according to respondents in Cleveland, Chicago, and Kansas City, and it held steady in New York and San Francisco. However, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City all noted an increase in mortgage refinancing activity given lower mortgage rates and Cleveland also noted continued strength in auto lending and increased demand for business loans. Meanwhile, business loan demand was described as down somewhat in Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City and was little changed in most other Districts. Loan standards were described as still tight for many classes of borrowers. That said, several Districts indicated that strong competition among banks for high quality borrowers was leading to lower rates and fees for these customers.       Agriculture and Natural Resources        Contacts generally reported that crop conditions at harvest were less favorable than a year ago, although results varied by and within Districts. Lower yields than a year ago were reported for major crops in the Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts and in most of the Kansas City District. Even so, yields were large enough to alleviate worries about shortages. Corn, soybean, and wheat prices moved down, while some contacts noted higher prices for cotton. Drought conditions persisted in the Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts, and pastures were in worse shape than a year ago in many areas. Although there were declines in feed costs, poultry and livestock producers remained pressured by drought and the cost increases of the past year. Hog, poultry, and dairy prices decreased, while cattle prices increased. Still, agricultural prices tended to be higher than a year ago, boosting farm incomes outside of drought-stricken areas. Chicago and Kansas City reported higher agricultural land values.              Activity in energy-producing sectors strengthened in the Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Atlanta reported a decrease in off-shore operations in the Gulf of Mexico due to Tropical Storm Lee. Cleveland and Atlanta also anticipated increased capital investments in oil and gas production, since new technology has lowered costs and boosted output. Contacts in Minneapolis reported plans for expanded wind generation of electricity. Mining activity in the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts was strong.       Employment, Wages, and Prices        Respondents indicated that labor market conditions were little changed, on balance, in September. Several Districts cited only limited and selective demand for new hires. Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City all noted that firms in some sectors that were hiring more broadly (such as manufacturing, transportation, and energy) were also experiencing difficulties in finding appropriately skilled or qualified labor. Respondents in the Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts indicated that hiring was being restrained by elevated uncertainty or lower expectations for their future growth. New York reported that deteriorating business conditions in the finance industry had led to a pull back in hiring with some layoffs anticipated in the months ahead. Richmond and Chicago reported reduced seasonal hiring in retail trade given apprehension about the strength of holiday sales, while New York indicated that seasonal hiring was likely to increase.              Most Districts reported that wage pressures remained subdued. Exceptions were generally for workers with specialized skills or in areas where firms were having difficulty finding workers. For instance, Atlanta and San Francisco cited wage gains for workers with specialized skills, such as in information technology, Minneapolis reported wage increases in the energy industry, and Cleveland noted higher wages for truck drivers. In addition, contacts in Minneapolis and Cleveland noted increases in non-wage costs such as healthcare. Most other cost pressures moderated in September. Although Kansas City and San Francisco reported increases in raw material costs, most Districts reported a general decline in commodity prices, including prices of oil and industrial metals. Many Districts indicated that there continued to be some further pass-through of past increases to wholesale prices. Though retail contacts noted a hesitation to increase prices with demand still weak, many Districts reported increased pass-through of costs in the retail sector, particularly for food and cotton-based goods.",2011-10-19

New York and Atlanta described tourism as robust and strong, while activity increased in Minneapolis and posted moderate improvement in Richmond. Boston noted that the travel and tourism sector continued to see strength in overseas and business travel, while discretionary domestic leisure spending was fueled by the affluent customer. In Richmond, tourism was largely flat, but some contacts were cautiously optimistic about the winter season. Airline contacts in Dallas expected to see stable demand through year-end. Strength in hotel bookings and occupancy were noted in Boston, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San Francisco.

St. Louis was mixed, while Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco indicated overall flat activity. Dallas reported that demand for staffing services held steady at high levels. St. Louis reported that firms in business support services, medical research services, and transportation services announced plans to expand operations and hire new workers, while contacts in temporary help services, government services, and education services announced plans to decrease operations. San Francisco noted that sales continued to grow for providers of technology services, in particular for software applications used for mobile computing and communication devices.       Manufacturing        Manufacturing activity grew at a steady pace across most of the country, with all Districts other than St. Louis reporting increases in orders, shipments, or production. Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco reported positive results in metals and fabrication, while Cleveland saw flat steel production and Philadelphia noted decreased demand for primary metals. Cleveland and Chicago reported increased auto production year over year, but Boston noted signs of slower auto component production. Dallas saw steady demand for electronics, computers, and high-technology goods, but San Francisco reported that demand for consumer electronics continued to decrease. Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago saw increased production of energy-related products. For construction-related goods, Chicago and Minneapolis reported declining demand, while Dallas said demand was stable. Overall, St. Louis saw more plant closures than plant openings or expansions. Freight transportation volumes increased in Cleveland, held steady in Atlanta and Kansas City, and were mixed in Dallas.       Banking and Finance        Overall bank lending activity increased slightly since the previous report. New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Kansas City reported increased loan demand. Several Districts reported an increase in home refinancing activity. Richmond reported mixed loan activity. Boston noted plentiful financing and favorable terms for premier properties, while financing remains harder to obtain for riskier properties and for those in secondary and tertiary markets. Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco noted relatively unchanged loans. Atlanta saw soft loan demand as companies continued to reduce their debt loads and limit expansion and capital improvement plans.              Changes in credit standards and credit quality varied across Districts. Philadelphia noted that credit quality continued to improve but at a slower rate. Kansas City saw stable or improving loan quality. Dallas noted that the quality of loans outstanding continued to improve, with contacts reporting a decline in problem loans. San Francisco saw a slight improvement in overall credit quality. Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis noted relatively unchanged credit quality. Boston, Richmond, and Atlanta saw some tightening of standards. In New York, bankers reported declining delinquency rates for commercial and industrial loans, but no change in delinquencies for other loan categories.

Boston, New York, Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco indicated roughly unchanged activity. Atlanta and Kansas City noted slight improvement. Philadelphia and Dallas indicated mixed activity. However, Richmond and St. Louis noted that vacancy rates increased. Commercial construction was somewhat mixed. Cleveland saw steady to slowly improving commercial construction; Chicago and Minneapolis experienced modest to moderate increases. New York and Philadelphia noted generally weak conditions; Richmond and St. Louis reported slow activity, although industrial construction picked up.       Agriculture and Natural Resources        Districts mostly reported favorable agricultural conditions. Harvests were ahead of pace or completed in Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City. The corn harvest was even with last year in Chicago and Minneapolis, while soybean production decreased. Wheat production was down dramatically in parts of the Minneapolis District. Corn and soybean yields were above average in the northern portions of the Kansas City District, but drought conditions severely cut crop production in the District's southern regions, and the winter wheat crops were in poor to fair condition. The severe drought in the Dallas District continued but eased slightly. Prices for most agricultural commodities except soybeans remained above year-earlier levels, and farm income increases were reported by Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City. Export demand remains strong for agricultural products, particularly meat, but Dallas reported a recent decrease in demand for grain exports.              Activity in the energy and mining sectors increased since the previous report. Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco saw increases in oil exploration. Cleveland and Dallas also reported growth in shale gas extraction. Coal production was flat in Cleveland and decreased slightly in St. Louis, though it is still up for the year. Minneapolis reported that more wind energy projects were planned. Mining activity increased in San Francisco and remained at elevated levels in Minneapolis.       Employment, Wages, and Prices        Hiring was generally subdued, but some firms with open positions reported difficulty finding qualified applicants. Stable employment levels or subdued hiring were mentioned by New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas. Assessments of labor market conditions were mixed in Richmond and St. Louis, while labor markets showed some signs of reduced availability of labor in Minneapolis. In Boston, demand for workers at services firms grew, but hiring among manufacturers was limited. In Kansas City, hiring plans among manufacturers remained solid, while expectations of future hiring among manufacturers in Philadelphia nearly doubled. Meanwhile, Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, and Minneapolis noted that some firms looking to fill open positions were having difficulty finding qualified workers, particularly for high-skilled manufacturing and technical positions. Atlanta noted there was growing concern that the skills of the unemployed were deteriorating.              Wages and salaries remained stable across Districts, although some exceptions were noted. In Cleveland, wage pressures emerged for truck drivers as the pool of available drivers shrank relative to job openings. Manufacturing wage growth strengthened in Richmond, while hiring stabilized and the average workweek was unchanged. Some wage growth was noted among the highly skilled trades in Atlanta. In Minneapolis, wages increased sharply at some fast food restaurants in western North Dakota. Kansas City reported that some energy and information technology firms raised wages for skilled workers; Dallas reported the same for airlines and a few construction-related manufacturers. San Francisco noted persistent upward pressure on benefit costs, especially for employee health care.              Overall price increases remained subdued, and some cost pressures were reported to have eased. Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City noted a moderation in input cost pressures. In Cleveland, manufacturers' reports on changes in raw materials prices were mixed; the transportation sector noted higher prices for tires, parts, and equipment; and fuel prices exhibited some volatility. Richmond reported that raw materials, retail, and services prices grew at a somewhat faster pace. Restaurants in Kansas City expected higher menu prices due to rising food costs. In Dallas, prices for new cars rose slightly, and staffing and legal services firms noted modest increases in billing rates, but natural gas prices remained low. San Francisco reported a recent uptick in the prices for energy inputs, particularly oil, and for assorted food items at the retail level. Atlanta noted that most businesses had limited ability to pass on increases in input prices from earlier in the year.",2011-11-30
79,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and based on information collected on or before December 30, 2011.  This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.           Contact reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that national economic activity expanded at a modest to moderate pace during the reporting period of late November through the end of December. Seven Districts characterized growth as modest; of the remaining five, New York and Chicago noted a pickup in the pace of growth, Dallas and San Francisco reported moderate growth, and Richmond indicated that activity flattened or improved slightly. Compared with prior summaries, the reports on balance suggest ongoing improvement in economic conditions in recent months, with most Districts highlighting more favorable conditions than identified in reports from the late spring through early fall.                  Consumer spending picked up in most Districts, reflecting significant gains in holiday retail sales compared with last year's season, and activity in the travel and tourism sector expanded in most areas. Demand strengthened further for nonfinancial services, including professional and transportation services. Manufacturing activity generally continued to expand, although the pace of growth has slowed for selected subsectors such as technology products. Agricultural producers and extractors of natural resources reported generally robust conditions. Activity stayed sluggish in residential real estate markets, and conditions in commercial real estate markets remained somewhat soft overall but showed signs of ongoing improvement in several Districts. Reports from financial institutions generally indicated a slight uptick in loan demand by businesses, along with improvements in overall credit quality.              Upward price pressures and price increases remained quite limited for most categories of final goods and services, as the effects of prior increases in the costs of selected inputs have eased. Upward wage pressures were modest overall, although a few Districts noted substantial compensation increases for workers with specialized skills in selected sectors and regions.       Consumer Spending and Tourism        Reports on consumer spending were favorable in general. Most Districts reported that holiday retail sales were up noticeably over last year's season, with New York and Dallas describing sales as ""brisk"" and ""robust,"" respectively. Consumer spending and confidence generally were characterized as firmer than in recent reporting periods, although Kansas City reported that spending softened. Items identified as the strongest holiday sellers by various Districts included consumer electronics and jewelry, and Chicago noted that luxury items in general sold well during the holiday season. By contrast, many Districts reported weak sales and excess inventories of warm clothing, due to unusually mild weather. Retail inventories more broadly were reported to be at or near desired levels, consistent with retailers' sales expectations. Boston, New York, and Minneapolis noted exceptional growth in Internet sales for selected items. Sales of new automobiles continued to pick up in most Districts. Among the more favorable reports, Atlanta noted that the pace of auto sales in November and December was ""the strongest in over two years,"" and strong demand and sales were reported as well by New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Minneapolis.              Reports from most Districts pointed to solid gains or high levels of travel and tourist activity, with pickups evident in both the business and leisure segments. Tourism activity was reported to be above the levels from twelve months earlier by Boston, New York, Richmond, and Atlanta, and Boston contacts expect double-digit growth in hotel revenues in 2012. By contrast, Minneapolis reported that tourist activity was down because limited snowfall has stymied outdoor activities such as skiing and snowmobiling, while Kansas City reported a decline because winter storms hampered some tourist activity. Business travel activity also has expanded of late and is above levels from twelve months earlier, according to Atlanta and San Francisco.       Nonfinancial Services        Demand generally strengthened further for nonfinancial services. Providers of professional and business services such as consulting, advertising, engineering, and legal services expanded their activities according to Boston, Richmond, St. Louis, and Minneapolis. Sales of technology services to businesses and consumers grew further, according to Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco, although the pace of growth slowed from earlier in 2011. Providers of temporary staffing services saw strong and rising demand in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Richmond Districts but below-average seasonal hiring in the Chicago and Dallas Districts. Reports from the health-care sector generally pointed to growth as well, with Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis highlighting construction activity and bank lending aimed at health-care providers. The exception to growing demand for health-care services was San Francisco, which reported an ongoing decline in hospital admissions. Demand for shipping and transportation services generally expanded. New York and Atlanta reported a significant increase in shipping tonnage by truck, and Dallas noted a broad-based increase in shipments by rail. Atlanta reported that port activity was up over twelve months earlier due to ""notable strength in exports,"" while Richmond reported a decline in port activity that was largely attributed to reduced imports. Air travel was above year-ago levels in the Atlanta District but unchanged over the past six weeks in the Dallas District.       Manufacturing        Manufacturing activity expanded in most Districts, generally continuing its steady overall expansion or, in the case of Atlanta, reversing a slowdown in prior periods. For the sector as a whole, further growth or improved conditions were reported by almost all Districts, except for Cleveland, Richmond, and Dallas, which reported that activity was largely stable or mixed, and Kansas City, which noted a slight decline. The strongest reports came from subsectors such as heavy equipment manufacturing and steel, for which demand has been boosted by robust growth in the energy, agricultural, and auto manufacturing sectors. Reports from Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis confirmed vibrant activity for auto manufacturers, primarily for domestic makes. By contrast, demand remained somewhat weak for firms in housing-related subsectors, such as a door manufacturer in the Richmond District, furniture manufacturers there and in the St. Louis and San Francisco Districts, and makers of lumber and wood products in the San Francisco District. Demand for computers and related electronic components rose further, according to Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. However, the pace of growth has slowed significantly from earlier in 2011, and Boston noted declining sales of semiconductors, mainly due to weaker demand from Asia. According to Dallas and San Francisco, aircraft makers saw further demand increases. Those Districts also noted weak domestic demand for refined petroleum products that was largely or completely offset by robust foreign demand. Demand grew smartly for food producers in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts, but in the Kansas City District food processing was one of the weakest performers within the manufacturing sector. Export sales of assorted manufactured products generally performed well according to Atlanta and Chicago, although slower economic growth in China and Europe held back sales for some manufacturers.              Cleveland reported that capacity utilization remained below normal in most subsectors, with the notable exception of steel producers, who were operating at or near normal levels. Similarly, Chicago noted that some auto suppliers appear to be approaching capacity constraints, which may limit further production increases in the near term. Atlanta reported that recent flooding in Thailand was likely to exert modest restraint on auto production. Ongoing capital investments and increases in capacity were reported for various manufacturing concerns in the St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts and for an auto producer in the Richmond District.       Real Estate and Construction        Activity in residential real estate markets largely held steady at very low levels, with the exception of further increases in the construction of multifamily residences. The pace of single-family home sales remained quite sluggish throughout the country, although the Dallas District reported a modest increase over the prior reporting period. Some Districts, such as Boston and Atlanta, noted that home sales exceeded levels from twelve months earlier, but mainly because the earlier levels reflected a substantial drop following the expiration of the homebuyers' tax credit in mid-2010. Prices were largely stable on a short-term basis in most areas but in many instances were below their levels from twelve months earlier. Extensive inventories of distressed properties were reported to be a source of price restraint in the Boston, Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts. Construction of single-family homes remained at depressed levels in most areas and fell further in some, such as the Philadelphia, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts. However, Cleveland reported that activity improved during the past couple of months. In contrast to the soft market for single-family residences, the market for rental units tightened in some areas such as the New York and Richmond Districts, and construction of multifamily residences rose in the Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts.              Demand for nonresidential real estate remained somewhat soft overall but improved in a number of Districts. Vacancy rates and other indicators in markets for office space were largely unchanged in the major metropolitan markets in the Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and St. Louis Districts. By contrast, New York reported that demand for office space ""picked up in late 2011,"" causing vacancy rates to edge down and asking rents to rise. Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, San Francisco, Atlanta, and Chicago all reported stronger demand for commercial real estate compared with earlier in 2011, and the latter two Districts also noted a pickup in nonresidential construction activity. Cleveland and Chicago reported that the strongest demand and most extensive construction activity has been for industrial and health-care facilities, while Minneapolis highlighted growing demand for industrial space and San Francisco stressed growing demand emanating from the information technology sector.       Banking and Finance        Lending activity edged up overall, primarily due to increased loan demand by businesses. Most Districts that commented on lending activity indicated little or no change in overall loan demand, but the remaining Districts identified increases rather than decreases. New York reported a pronounced increase in demand for commercial mortgages, and Cleveland also noted increased demand in this category. Both Dallas and San Francisco noted a slight uptick in commercial and industrial lending. Consumer lending was largely flat compared with the prior reporting period, although auto loans rose in Cleveland. New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland reported demand growth or continued strength for refinancing of residential mortgages.              Lending standards were largely unchanged across all lending categories. However, New York reported slight tightening for commercial and industrial loans. Moreover, a few reports highlighted that small businesses continued to struggle with credit access through banks. In the Atlanta District, some small businesses have turned to nonbank institutions for financing, and in the Chicago District some manufacturers have been financing loans to their suppliers from retained earnings. Credit quality improved in many Districts: New York reported a decline in delinquency rates for all loan categories, while Philadelphia, Richmond, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco all reported general improvement in loan quality.       Agriculture and Natural Resources        Demand for agricultural products was strong during the reporting period, but growing conditions and input prices were mixed. Farm income and profits were reported to be at very high levels by Chicago and Kansas City, enabling many farmers to repay loans and expand their operations, and San Francisco reported further sales growth for a variety of agricultural products. Rising foreign demand was noted as a source of strength for livestock sales in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts and for dairy and meat products in the Chicago District. Growing conditions were somewhat mixed across areas. Farmers and livestock producers in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts have been struggling with ongoing droughts, which have required costly responses such as supplemental feeding of livestock. While timely rains eased drought conditions somewhat in the Dallas and Kansas City Districts, wheat farmers in the latter are hoping for more protective snow cover for the winter crop's dormancy period. In addition, high or rising prices for some inputs were noted by Chicago and Kansas City, tempering farmers' profit expectations for the coming year.              Demand and extraction activity rose further for producers of natural resource products. Energy extraction has been on the upswing. Atlanta reported that companies have been expanding their workforces and increasing their production capacity and exploration plans in the Gulf of Mexico. Minneapolis and Kansas City reported that oil and gas exploration and extraction activity were well above their levels from twelve months earlier, and Dallas noted that a high level of activity is expected to resume in early 2012 following a year-end seasonal lull. Minneapolis and San Francisco reported expansion of mining capacity and activity for a range of industrial and precious metals.       Prices and Wages        Upward price pressures and price increases were very limited during the reporting period. Reports from various Districts, including Boston, Atlanta, and Chicago, indicated that upward price pressures from rising commodity and input prices have eased substantially, with Boston noting that ""even food prices have ceased rising."" Atlanta reported that firms have limited pricing power in general, and San Francisco pointed to intense supplier competition as a factor holding down prices. Similarly, Kansas City reported a recent uptick in input prices but noted that few manufacturers passed these increases on to the prices of their finished goods.              Wage pressures remained modest overall. The combination of limited permanent hiring in most sectors and numerous active job seekers has continued to keep a lid on general wage increases. However, reports from a few Districts highlighted significant supply constraints and in some cases large compensation increases for workers with specialized skills in selected sectors, including the energy sector in the Dallas District and the technology sector in the San Francisco District. On a related note, Minneapolis reported that employers have increased relocation pay for employees willing to settle in parts of that District where worker availability is limited. Increases in the costs of employee health benefits continued to put significant upward pressure on overall compensation costs, although some employers in the Philadelphia District reported significant rollbacks from past increases.",2012-01-11
80,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and based on information collected on or before February 17, 2012. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.            Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that overall economic activity continued to increase at a modest to moderate pace in January and early February. Activity expanded at a moderate pace in the Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. St. Louis noted a modest pace of growth and Minneapolis characterized the pace of growth as firm. Economic activity rose at a somewhat faster pace in the Philadelphia and Atlanta Districts, while the New York District noted a somewhat slower pace of expansion. The Boston and Richmond Districts, in turn, noted that economic activity expanded or improved in most sectors.                  Manufacturing continued to expand at a steady pace across the nation, with many Districts reporting increases in new orders, shipments, or production and several Districts indicating gains in capital spending, especially in auto-related industries. Activity in nonfinancial services industries remained stable or increased. Reports of consumer spending were generally positive except for sales of seasonal items, and the sales outlook for the near future was mostly optimistic. Tourism remained strong in some reporting Districts, but declined in the Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts because of reduced snowfall. Residential real estate market conditions improved somewhat in most Districts, with several reports of increased home sales and some reports of increased construction. Commercial real estate markets also showed positive results in some Districts. Banking conditions generally improved across the Districts. Agricultural conditions were mixed, while extraction activity generally increased.              Hiring increased slightly across several Districts, and contacts in a variety of industries faced difficulties finding skilled workers. Wage pressures were generally contained, and prices of final goods remained stable, although contacts in some Districts anticipate passing rising input prices through to consumer prices.       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity        Manufacturing has continued to increase across all twelve Federal Reserve Districts since the previous report. Most Districts reported gains in new orders, shipments, or production. Contacts reported increased capital spending in the Boston, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts; contacts in Philadelphia and Cleveland also anticipate higher capital spending. Manufacturing contacts in San Francisco also continued to invest in information technology equipment. Auto-related manufacturers in the Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Districts reported increased activity and announced plans to expand operations and open new plants. Primary metal manufacturing showed strong growth in the Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Dallas Districts. Fabricated metal manufacturing increased in the Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts but was essentially flat in the San Francisco District. Steel producers reported that shipping volume was trending higher in the Cleveland District and specialty metal contacts reported solid order bookings in the Chicago District. In contrast to the many positive reports, contacts in some Districts reported plans to decrease operations and close plants. Contacts in chemical and paper product manufacturing in the St. Louis District reported plans to close plants and lay off workers, while manufacturers of household goods and building materials reported soft demand on average in the Chicago District. Manufacturing contacts in the Boston, Philadelphia, and Cleveland Districts expressed concern about the risks posed by the situation in Europe.              Nonfinancial services activity was stable or increased in the New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Transportation services were stable or trending higher in the Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, and Dallas Districts. In contrast, freight transportation contacts in the St. Louis and Kansas City Districts reported that business had slowed. Information technology service firms in the Boston, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts have experienced increased demand since the previous reporting period. Additionally, contacts in health care announced plans to increase capital spending or expand operations in the Richmond and St. Louis Districts.       Consumer Spending and Tourism        Retail sales in the Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts were higher than year-earlier sales. The Boston District reported strong same-store sales in the last few months of 2011, but mixed results for same-store sales in January. Retail sales increased in the Richmond and San Francisco Districts, but were mixed in the New York and Cleveland Districts and weakened in the Kansas City District. Retail sales growth in the Dallas District was tepid and consumer spending growth slowed in the Chicago District. The Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas Districts noted that mild winter weather had depressed sales of seasonal items. Mark-downs on winter merchandise to clear inventory were reported in the Boston, Chicago, and Richmond Districts. Aside from unsold seasonal items, inventories were more broadly reported to be at satisfactory levels. All Districts reporting sales expectations for the coming months indicated optimism among contacts that sales will improve.              Gains in auto sales were reported in the Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Districts. Chicago also reported sales increases in January, but noted that sales were down slightly in early February. Auto dealers in the New York, Cleveland, and Richmond Districts reported a slowdown in recent auto sales, while auto sales held steady in the Dallas District and contacts in the Kansas City District reported a post-holiday lull in sales. All Districts reporting on sales outlooks conveyed optimism. Dealers in the Kansas City District expect demand for smaller, fuel-efficient cars to spur sales in coming months, while contacts in the Cleveland District were optimistic but uncertain that sales increases in 2011 could be repeated in 2012.              Tourism strengthened or remained strong in the New York, Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts. The Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts reported a decrease in tourism largely attributed to below-average snowfall.

Some Districts, including Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco noted cost pressures eased as the price of energy inputs fell. However, Atlanta's report noted some firms had implemented price increases tied to previous increases in energy costs, and firms in the Kansas City District noted higher input and final goods prices.",2012-06-06
83,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and based on information collected before July 9, 2012. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.          Reports from most of the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that overall economic activity continued to expand at a modest to moderate pace in June and early July. The Atlanta, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts reported modest growth, while Boston, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas described economic activity as advancing moderately. The New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland Districts noted that activity continued to expand, but at a slower pace since the last report, while Richmond cited mixed activity.                  Retail sales increased slightly in all reporting Districts except Boston and Cleveland, where sales were categorized as flat, and New York, where sales softened. Of the Districts that saw an increase in activity, most noted strength in auto sales. In particular, auto dealers noted that demand for fuel-efficient vehicles continued to support sales. Tourism activity remained strong according to contacts in the New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts.              All District housing market reports were largely positive as sales and construction levels increased and home inventories declined. Rental markets continued to strengthen with rising rents being reported in Boston, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas. Commercial real estate leasing and construction continued to improve as demand for multifamily units increased in Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco. However, both New York and Richmond noted a slowdown in commercial activity, while Philadelphia and Dallas held steady.              Manufacturing activity continued to expand slowly in most Districts, and Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City cited slight increases in production levels. However, several Districts reported a deceleration in new orders, and the Philadelphia and Richmond Districts reported declines in shipments and orders. Demand for nonfinancial services remained generally stable in most regions. Richmond noted strong sales among professional, scientific, and technical firms, while Dallas noted strength in energy, legal, and audit-related services. Transportation reports were generally positive, with Kansas City noting an uptick in trucking activity, while Richmond reported increased port activity.              Demand for loans, particularly those related to real estate, grew modestly in most Districts. However, both Cleveland and Richmond noted some weakness in loan activity. Credit standards remained unchanged in New York, Richmond, and Kansas City, while credit quality improved in Philadelphia, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Agricultural production and pricing reports were mixed. While drought conditions have affected production in some Districts, others noted favorable conditions. Chicago and Kansas City reported a significant deterioration of corn crops, which has pushed up prices since the end of June.              All Districts conveyed that input prices had stabilized in recent months. Price pressures were described as easing in New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and San Francisco as energy costs declined. Wage pressures remained modest, except for highly skilled workers in information technology, health care, transportation, and manufacturing. Employment levels improved at a tepid pace for most Districts. Overall, Districts reported that their contacts remained cautiously optimistic about future business conditions.       Consumer Spending and Tourism        Most Districts reported modest increases in retail spending on a year-over-year basis, but many reported slower growth in recent months compared with earlier in the year; however, Boston and Cleveland reported sales as flat, and New York cited softer sales. There were a few reports that high summer temperatures negatively affected sales. Sales of big-ticket household goods were strong in the Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts, while sales were reportedly flat for home furnishings and major appliances in the San Francisco District. Boston reported that sales for furniture and electronics had slowed, and retailers in the New York District reported that home goods sales were weak. Reports from luxury-goods retailers were mixed. Firms in the Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts reported that sales of high-end goods remained strong, while retailers in the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts indicated demand had softened, and those in the Cleveland District noted that sales of luxury goods had slowed. Most Districts reported that vehicle sales remained robust. Demand was high for fuel-efficient vehicles in particular. Looking forward, merchants in the Boston and Philadelphia Districts were concerned that economic uncertainty could result in restrained sales growth, while retailers in the Cleveland District anticipated that the third quarter will be higher compared with year-ago levels. Kansas City noted that merchants there expected further strengthening in the coming months.              Travel and tourism activity was reported as strong across several Districts. Hotel occupancy rates and revenue per room were robust in many areas according to reports from New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco. Attendance numbers were solid at attractions in various Districts, including theme parks in Florida and New York's Broadway theaters. Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco reported that natural disasters had negatively affected bookings in some parts of their Districts. Dallas reported that demand for international travel was strongest for South America and Mexico destinations. Atlanta shared their contacts' concerns about the potential impact of economic and financial stress abroad and the effect it could have on international travel. That said, several Districts reported that the outlook among the majority of hospitality contacts for the remainder of the summer is good as hotel and convention bookings continued to exceed last year's pace.       Real Estate and Construction        Reports on residential housing markets remained largely positive. Sales were characterized as improving in Philadelphia, New York, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis, while home sales increased in Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. However, reports on sales were mixed in the New York District, and gains in the Boston District eased from earlier in the year. New home sales were described as disappointing in the Philadelphia District. Construction increased in the New York, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, while reports from the Cleveland District said construction slowed. Most Districts reported declines in home inventories. Homes prices have begun to stabilize in some markets and price increases were noted in select markets. Boston and Atlanta noted that appraisals were coming in below market prices.              Rental markets continued to strengthen by most accounts. Rising apartment rents were reported in the Boston, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas Districts. Strong demand for rental units spurred increases in multifamily construction in the San Francisco District. Multifamily construction was described as strong in the Atlanta and Chicago Districts. Apartment construction is expected to pick up over the next several months in the Dallas District.              Recent activity in commercial real estate markets has been mixed. Modest improvements were noted in Boston, Atlanta, and St. Louis and demand strengthened in the San Francisco District. Softer conditions were reported in the New York and Richmond Districts, while demand held steady in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts. Nonresidential construction activity varied as well. Construction activity increased modestly in the Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts, while construction continued to gain momentum in the Boston District. Demand for commercial construction rose in Chicago, while activity was described as much improved from a year earlier in the Cleveland District. Construction was flat in the Atlanta District on a year-over-year basis, while activity had softened in recent months in the Richmond District. Overall, the outlook among commercial real estate contacts and contractors was slightly positive.       Manufacturing        Manufacturing continued to expand in June and early July in most Districts, but at a more modest pace compared with earlier in the year. Several Districts reported that new orders had moderated since the last report, but the Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts were more optimistic that new orders would rebound. The Philadelphia and Richmond Districts however, reported declines in shipments and orders. The passing of a transportation bill through Congress led contacts in the Philadelphia District to express interest in increasing their capital spending. Capacity utilization rates at refineries and petrochemical manufacturing facilities held steady in the San Francisco District, with weaker domestic demand being offset by growing exports. Meanwhile, manufacturers in the Dallas District reported operating at above 90 percent utilization rates to catch up with below-normal inventory levels.              The San Francisco District noted continued strength in semiconductor production, while the Dallas District said sales at high-tech manufacturing had decreased since the last report. Expectations from high-tech manufacturers in the Dallas District were that growth would remain flat to slightly weaker through year's end, a change from earlier in the year when most contacts anticipated a pick-up in the second half. Overall, most Districts reported a moderation of expectations among their manufacturing contacts.              Hiring at manufacturing firms continued to vary by District. Kansas City said that fewer plant managers were planning to hire, while the St. Louis District reported plans for plant expansions later in the year. The Dallas District cited particular strength in food production, citing contacts who said they planned to add several new workers. However, makers of food products in the Philadelphia District noted a falloff in demand. Cleveland and Chicago noted that automobile production remained a source of strength, with contacts from the Chicago District reporting that there was an increase in research and development activity.       Nonfinancial Services        Demand for nonfinancial services was generally stable to slightly stronger since the previous report. Richmond noted that revenue improvement was strong among professional, scientific, and technical firms. Strength in energy, legal, and audit-related services was noted in the Dallas District. Advertisers in the Philadelphia and San Francisco Districts reported strong revenues, and consulting and advertising contacts in the Boston District noted steady activity. Richmond and San Francisco reported that restaurants were busy, while food service contacts in Atlanta reported that demand had softened a bit.              Transportation contacts reported that activity was generally positive. In the Atlanta and Dallas Districts, rail contacts reported strong shipments of petroleum and motor vehicles and equipment. The Richmond District reported increases in port activity with container volumes and tonnage at or near record levels. Input from logistics and trucking contacts was mixed. The Cleveland and Atlanta Districts noted softening volumes and less-robust forecasts for the remainder of the year. Kansas City's report cited an uptick in trucking activity, while San Francisco's report cited moderating growth in trucking.       Banking and Financial Services        Overall loan demand grew modestly in most Districts. New York indicated no change, while Richmond observed flat-to-weakening loan demand. Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco noted increased commercial and industrial lending, but lending in that sector decreased somewhat in the New York District and was characterized as soft in Cleveland and Atlanta. Most Districts reported an increase in mortgage lending, with Dallas noting especially strong demand and a healthy backlog of loans. Refinancing of mortgage loans was steady or increasing in New York, Cleveland, Richmond, and Chicago, but Philadelphia noted a recent slowdown. Kansas City and Dallas noted some improvement in lending for agriculture and commercial real estate. The Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts observed steady-to-increasing demand for consumer credit, especially for auto loans, while consumer loan demand was somewhat weaker in Kansas City and little changed in Cleveland.              Contacts in the New York, Richmond and Kansas City Districts reported that credit standards remained largely unchanged. Cleveland reported some loosening of auto lending guidelines, while San Francisco indicated credit standards were somewhat restrictive for businesses and consumer loans. Philadelphia, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco noted general improvements in credit quality. Delinquency rates held steady or declined in the New York and Cleveland Districts. Banking contacts in the Cleveland, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts noted stiff competition for quality loan customers. The Chicago District noted uncertainty over the effects of U.S. fiscal policy actions was reducing their customers' demand for credit. Likewise, Dallas reported a slightly more pessimistic outlook than the previous Beige Book due in part to European debt issues and regulatory and political uncertainty.       Agriculture and Natural Resources        Agricultural conditions were mixed since the previous report. Several Districts noted areas of increased drought resulting in stress to crops and livestock, while rainfall provided needed moisture to parts of the Atlanta District. With high heat and drought cited as the cause, the Chicago and Kansas City Districts reported concerns for their corn and soybean crops, while the Minneapolis District reported that favorable weather conditions contributed to their corn and soybean crops doing well. The Kansas City and Dallas Districts reported drought-stressed pasture conditions, although the Dallas District noted much better crop conditions than this time last year. The St. Louis and Kansas City Districts reported better-than-expected yields for the winter wheat crop nearing completion. The San Francisco District noted further sales growth for many crop and livestock products, attributed in part to overseas growth, but suggested that this source of growth was decreasing. The Kansas City District cited rising export demand as the reason some hog producers expanded production. Agricultural price reports were mixed. While June corn prices were reported down on a year-over-year basis, reports of corn crop deterioration was noted by the Chicago and Kansas City Districts as having pushed corn prices sharply higher since the end of June.              Several Districts reported that energy exploration activity had increased, with offshore prospects being aided by recent lease sales. Regions where coal production is prevalent noted that extraction had decreased over the last year with electricity generation shifting to natural gas. Contacts in many Districts shared expectations that natural gas prices will remain low in the near future. Corn producing regions reported that ethanol processing had decreased in response to the higher corn prices.       Employment, Wages, and Prices        Employment levels grew at a tepid pace for most Districts since the last report. The Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas Districts said employment levels were flat to up slightly, with most contacts citing U.S. fiscal policy uncertainty or weak demand for their conservative approach to hiring. Kansas City said employers were reluctant to increase wages or hire full-time staff until economic uncertainty diminishes. A Richmond District employment agency contact noted an increase in temporary employment turning into permanent positions since the last report. The Atlanta District noted some smaller chain stores with low price points were expanding and hiring at a significant pace. Several Districts noted that employers were having difficulty filling highly skilled positions.              Many Districts noted that wage pressures were minimal since the last report. Wage increases were mostly concentrated in highly skilled workers in information technology, health care, transportation, some professional services, and highly skilled manufacturing workers, according to reports from the Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts.              Price inflation was modest across most areas of the country. Lower input prices for various commodities were mentioned across most Districts and resulted in expectations of stable input prices in the coming months. Retailers and manufacturers in the Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas Districts noted a decline in cotton prices. Manufacturers in the Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts mentioned that steel and scrap metal prices have moderated. The decline in energy prices was mentioned in the Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas reports as contributing to lower cost expectations. However, contractors and building contacts in the Philadelphia, Richmond, and Kansas City Districts noted increases in the cost of building supply materials. Richmond contractors said they were able to pass these costs through, but homebuilders in Philadelphia mentioned limited ability to do so.",2012-07-18
84,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and based on information collected on or before August 20, 2012. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.          Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest economic activity continued to expand gradually in July and early August across most regions and sectors. Six Districts indicated the local economy continued to expand at a modest pace and another three cited moderate growth; among the latter, Chicago noted that the pace of growth had slowed from the prior period. The Philadelphia and Richmond Districts reported slow growth in most sectors and declines in manufacturing, while Boston cited mixed reports from business contacts and some slowdown since the previous report.                  Most Districts indicated that retail activity, including auto sales, had increased since the last Beige Book report, although Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco noted the retail improvements were small. Atlanta said that retail growth had slowed, while Philadelphia indicated growth in retail sales was somewhat faster than in the previous report. Boston, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San Francisco recorded strong performance in tourism. Many Districts reported some softening in manufacturing, either a slowdown in the rate of growth or a decline in the level of sales, output, or orders; among those with declining shipments and orders, Philadelphia noted that the rate of decline was tempering.              Districts mentioning nonfinancial services noted increased activity, although at a slowing pace in Boston, softening in New York, and ""flattening"" in Philadelphia; Kansas City reported that sales of high-tech services declined slightly. Several Districts cited declining demand for staffing services. According to District reports, bankers in New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City saw increases in demand for most loan types in recent months; by contrast, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco indicated that loan demand was mixed, softening, or slightly weaker.              Real estate markets were generally said to be improving. On the residential side, all 12 Districts cited increases in home sales, home prices, or housing construction. Reports on commercial real estate markets were also generally positive, although San Francisco noted stable demand, Boston indicated conditions were not much changed since the last report, and Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis said commercial real estate conditions were mixed.              District reports indicated that energy and mining activity was generally high and increasing. However, Cleveland noted softening demand for coal, while Minneapolis and Kansas City had some energy sectors up and some down. The Midwest drought has reduced actual and expected farm output, especially cotton, soybean, and/or corn crops in the Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis Districts.              Most Districts reported that the selling prices of manufacturing and retail products were largely stable. By exception, several Districts noted concerns about rising agricultural commodity prices, and Richmond mentioned a small uptick in retail prices. Hiring was said to be modest across the Districts, and wage pressures were characterized as contained.       Consumer Spending and Tourism        Most Districts reported that retail spending in July and early August was up compared with the previous Beige Book. New York and San Francisco noted strengthening sales compared with a softer May and June, although in San Francisco's case, the rise was only ""a bit further."" Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis, and Kansas City reported stronger retail sales, while Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas all said that sales were up ""slightly."" In the Atlanta District, most retail contacts reported slower sales, while Boston's retail contacts provided a mixed assessment. The Atlanta and San Francisco reports noted that discount retailers performed better than traditional department stores, while the Chicago report attributed the pace of growth in consumer spending to heavy discounting by retailers clearing space for back-to-school items. Boston and Chicago reported continuing weakness in furniture sales; Boston also reported weak sales of electronics, but Chicago noted some improvement in this category. Adult clothing sold well in Boston, Chicago, and Dallas. The Atlanta District said that luxury goods merchants, while still largely positive, provided more mixed reports compared with earlier this year; Kansas City cited weaker sales for high-end jewelry. For the remainder of 2012, Boston retailers have mixed sales expectations, Philadelphia retailers are cautiously optimistic, and those in Atlanta are conservative; retail contacts in Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas expect sales to rise through the end of the year.              Automobile sales are up in the New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts, flat in Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas, and a bit slower paced in Richmond and San Francisco; nonetheless, vehicle demand in the latter two Districts is still strong, especially for used cars. The New York District reported that new car sales are ""particularly robust"" and Kansas City cited a sharp increase in new vehicle sales. Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City indicated that car dealers in their Districts expected these strong automobile sales to continue, while the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts reported concerns that consumer uncertainty might depress vehicle sales in coming months.              Respondents in the Boston, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts reported that tourist industry performance remains strong. The Atlanta District mentioned that Florida contacts reported a drop in European travelers, but said this decline was offset by an increase in business from Central and South America. Contacts in Boston noted some concern that weakness in Europe could soften tourist activity and that rising gas prices could affect leisure travel. The San Francisco District reported that the pace of growth had slowed in Las Vegas and other areas.       Manufacturing and Related Services        The picture in manufacturing was mixed. The Boston, Chicago, Kansas City and San Francisco Districts reported increasing demand and sales since the previous Beige Book, although the improvement was generally small and uneven, with two of these four Districts reporting that demand growth, while positive, was slowing. Six Districts reported that demand for manufactured goods was actually falling, although none reported a dramatic fall. The outlook was somewhat more positive, with six Districts reporting that manufacturers expected increasing demand and only two reporting the opposite.              Areas of strength were varied. The Cleveland and Philadelphia Districts both pointed to the revolution in natural gas production in the United States as a driver of demand, but the Chicago District said that a contact blamed cheap natural gas for weakness in demand for coal. Several Districts noted that improvements in residential construction boosted demand for products such as lumber, PVC, cement, and home goods. The Chicago and Philadelphia Districts said that auto production was positive, but Richmond said the opposite.              Weakness overseas remains a problem for U.S. manufacturing. Reports from the Boston, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts explicitly mentioned it. Although Europe represented one notable problem, several Districts also mentioned weakness in demand in Asia as an issue. In general, District reports indicate that the cost and availability of raw materials has not been an issue for manufacturers recently, especially as compared with the situation in previous years. Four Districts reported lower input costs, but contacts in New York reported a slight increase.              On the employment front, there was little movement. Across all Districts, few manufacturing firms reported any major hiring or layoffs, and the ones that did usually attributed it to idiosyncratic factors like new products or restructuring related to a merger. The Cleveland District reported that firms continued to have trouble finding skilled workers. Capital spending also showed little change; in addition, several Districts reported that contacted manufacturers had not revised their investment plans.       Nonfinancial Services        Activity in nonfinancial services generally picked up since the previous report, although results were mixed across Districts and service industries. New York and Philadelphia reported that overall service-sector activity was flat to down slightly, whereas Minneapolis and San Francisco noted expanding activity. Several Districts, including Boston, Richmond, and San Francisco, reported steady to increasing demand for information technology services; Kansas City, by contrast, cited decreased sales at high-tech services firms. Reports from the healthcare sector were also somewhat mixed, with Philadelphia and St. Louis reporting positive results and San Francisco noting a drop in the frequency of elective procedures. Advertisers in the Philadelphia and San Francisco Districts continued to report strong revenues. In the Dallas District, legal firms reported continued increases in demand for services, while accounting firms cited seasonal slowness. Demand for staffing services was generally lower than expected, with decreases reported by Boston, New York, Richmond, and Dallas. Even so, demand remained strong for highly skilled IT personnel in the Boston and Richmond Districts.              Reports on transportation services were generally positive. Rail contacts reported continued increases in intermodal shipments in the Atlanta District and increased cargo volumes in the Dallas District, with both Districts recognizing gains in lumber shipments. Atlanta and Dallas also reported steady to increasing demand for trucking services, whereas logistics firms and carriers in the Philadelphia District reported a relatively sluggish start to the traditional ""freight season.""       Banking and Financial Services        Credit conditions have improved over the reporting period according to District reports. Credit spreads were lower and competition for high-quality borrowers among lending institutions has increased. The New York District noted that shrinking spreads were observed particularly in commercial and industrial loans as well as in commercial mortgages. Some bankers in the Cleveland District mentioned a moderate loosening of lending guidelines. The New York, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts reported unchanged credit standards; New York and Cleveland cited declining delinquency rates.              The direction and magnitude of changes in loan demand varied among the Districts and also with respect to type of loan. The Richmond and Atlanta Districts reported generally low demand for loans, but some pockets of growth. The Chicago District noted that growth in business loan demand was generated mostly from small and mid-size firms and for the purpose of refinancing rather than financing capital expenditures. Cleveland, St. Louis, and San Francisco mentioned small positive or negative changes in business credit demand, and relatively strong demand for consumer credit. The Kansas City District reported stable demand for commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans, while Dallas noted softer demand for loans overall; however, both Districts cited increases in demand for residential real estate loans. The New York and Philadelphia Districts observed growth in most lending categories.       Real Estate and Construction        Housing markets across most Districts exhibited signs of improvement, with sales and construction continuing to increase. Dallas reported significant levels of buyer traffic, Richmond noted strong pending sales, and Minneapolis and St. Louis mentioned increases in building permits. New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago indicated improvements as well, but characterized the progress as slow and modest. Declines in inventory levels were reported in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco; these declining inventories put some upward pressure on prices according to Boston, Atlanta, and Dallas. A reduction in the stock of distressed properties was mentioned in New York, Richmond, and San Francisco. In Philadelphia and Kansas City, the possibility of shadow inventory entering the market remains a concern. In general, outlooks were positive, with continued increases in activity expected, although the projected gains were more modest in Boston, Cleveland, and Kansas City.              Commercial real estate market conditions held steady or improved in nearly all Districts in recent weeks. New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Kansas City all reported that commercial leasing increased and vacancy rates fell. New York and Kansas City reported increases in office rents as well; Kansas City also cited a rise in commercial construction. Commercial building permits were up significantly from one year ago in portions of the Minneapolis District. Chicago's report was mixed: office vacancy rates remained high, restraining demand for new office construction, but office leasing demand improved modestly and industrial construction picked up. Atlanta reported rising apartment rents and small gains in office leasing, with weakness in the retail and industrial sectors. Boston reported that office fundamentals were flat on average, with rising rents in portions of Boston proper and muted but steady activity elsewhere in the District. Nonresidential construction picked up in the Boston and Cleveland Districts. Office and industrial real estate markets remained healthy in Dallas. The St. Louis report noted an increase in commercial construction across much of the District and varied reports on leasing across areas within the District. In San Francisco, demand for commercial property was stable while commercial construction was limited. Richmond reported a decline in office leasing volume in Washington, D.C., but some portions of the District recorded increasing sales and construction. Multifamily real estate remained a strong submarket and a key driver of construction in many Districts, including Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco.       Agriculture and Natural Resources        According to District reports, agricultural conditions were mixed largely because of severe drought conditions that affected the Midwest more than the rest of the country. Producers in the Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts were all severely affected by the drought, with cotton, soybean, and corn crops particularly damaged. Cotton production in the Dallas District was also badly damaged, while the northern part of the Minneapolis District reported good corn, soybean, and wheat crops, and the San Francisco and Richmond Districts reported strong demand for their healthy cotton crops. Although nearly all agricultural commodity prices rose, higher feed costs led to reduced herd sizes and lower livestock prices in nearly all Districts reporting on livestock. Reports from the Richmond and Kansas City Districts indicated that farmland values have continued to rise, although contacts in the Kansas City District expected them to hold steady for the rest of the year. Farm incomes generally rose or stayed the same in the Minneapolis District.              Oil and gas activity continued to be robust across most Districts. Extraction of natural gas and petroleum remained at high levels in the Dallas and Minneapolis Districts and expanded in the Cleveland and Richmond Districts, partly because of increased demand from electrical utilities. Production increased in Gulf Coast oil refineries in the Atlanta District as a result of closures along the East Coast, while higher demand for crude oil, diesel, and other distillates supported prices. However, natural gas producers in the Cleveland, Richmond, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts reported a decline in exploration and drilling of new wells on account of high inventories and low prices. Coal demand was unchanged from 2011 in the St. Louis District but was expected to fall below 2011 levels in the Cleveland District due to reduced demand for thermal coal from domestic utilities and metallurgical coal from Europe and Asia. Iron ore, taconite, and sand mines in the Minneapolis District continued to operate at high capacity.       Employment, Wages, and Prices        Most Districts reported that employment was holding steady or growing only slightly. Several Districts including Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond noted a softening in employment relative to expectations; upcoming layoffs were reported by a defense contractor in the Boston District and by firms in sectors such as air transportation, appliances, and business support services in the St Louis District. Almost all Districts indicated that manufacturers were continuing to hire, albeit modestly. Demand has been strongest for skilled manufacturing and engineering positions, as well as for IT services. Contacts in the Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts all reported some difficulty meeting demand for truck drivers.              Overall, upward wage pressure was reported to be very contained across Districts. The Philadelphia and Chicago Districts both noted that despite little wage pressure, some contacts reported upward pressures for medical benefits. Sources from Boston and Atlanta mentioned that continuing demand was putting some upward pressure on wages for highly-skilled positions in software, engineering, and information technology. The San Francisco District also noted specialized IT positions as an exception to generally limited wage growth. The Dallas District reported upward wage pressure for truck drivers and construction workers, and the Minneapolis District noted wage increases in areas with increased oil drilling.              Most Districts reported that overall prices for finished goods were relatively stable despite somewhat increased input prices. Higher prices for grain and other food commodities were cited by many Districts, primarily due to the drought. The Cleveland District noted increased upward pressure on lumber prices, while contacts in Boston, Philadelphia, and Minneapolis reported higher gasoline prices as a potential concern. Chicago mentioned some pass-through of higher crop prices to wholesale prices, while contacts in the Kansas City and Richmond Districts expected to raise future prices in response to more expensive raw materials.",2012-08-29
85,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and based on information collected on or before September 28, 2012. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.           Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that economic activity generally expanded modestly since the last report. The New York District noted a leveling off in economic activity, and Kansas City indicated some slowing in the pace of growth. In general, other Districts reported that growth continued at a modest pace.                  Consumer spending was generally reported to be flat to up slightly since the last report. A number of Districts characterized retail sales as expanding at a modest pace, while reports from New York, Chicago, and Kansas City indicated flat or softening sales. Vehicle sales were also generally characterized as stable but up from a year earlier and generally at favorable levels. Used car sales were mixed. Most Districts described tourism as fairly robust, though Kansas City noted some general softening, while New York and Dallas indicated some scattered signs of weakening.              Residential real estate conditions improved since the last report. Most Districts reported strengthening in existing home sales, while prices were described as steady to increasing, with declining inventories noted in the Boston, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Residential construction was also described as rising in most Districts. Commercial real estate markets were mixed since the last report. Office markets showed signs of softening in the northeastern Districts--Boston, New York, and Philadelphia--while most other Districts reported stable or mixed market conditions. Industrial markets showed some strength in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Atlanta Districts, while softer conditions were noted in Richmond.              Conditions in the manufacturing sector were mixed but, on balance, somewhat improved since the last report. The Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts reported some expansion in activity, whereas New York, Chicago, and Minneapolis reported some weakening in activity. The nonfinancial services sector showed modest improvement in the latest reporting period. Richmond, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco reported some expansion in activity, while New York and Philadelphia indicated steady or mixed conditions.              Overall loan demand was steady to stronger in most Districts. Credit standards were little changed since the last report, and a number of Districts noted improvements in loan quality or steady to declining delinquency rates. Agricultural conditions were mixed, with drought conditions continuing to adversely affect much of the mid-section of the nation. Activity in the energy sector remained robust.              Districts mostly reported little change in prices of both finished goods and inputs. Prices for agricultural commodities and petroleum-based products were generally reported to be higher, while natural gas prices were said to be low or declining. Employment conditions were little changed since the last report. Several Districts continued to report shortages of highly skilled workers, but otherwise wage pressures remained modest. Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago noted increases in the costs of employee medical benefits.       Consumer Spending and Tourism        Consumer spending was mixed but generally reported to be flat to up slightly over the latest reporting period. Retail sales were said to have improved modestly in the Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts, while sales were characterized as flat to softer in the New York and Kansas City Districts. In general, retail sales were reported to be running only modestly ahead of a year ago. A number of reports noted various factors affecting sales, such as rising gasoline prices, political uncertainty, concerns about the ""fiscal cliff"" and weather. Atlanta and San Francisco noted that discounters have been outperforming traditional department stores. Cleveland reported that back-to-school merchandise sold well, while Chicago said that such sales were below expectations. Boston noted a pickup in furniture sales, Richmond cited brisk sales at building supplies stores, and San Francisco reported stronger demand at restaurants and food-service establishments.              Vehicle sales were mixed but generally at favorable levels. Sales of new vehicles were steady to stronger and running ahead of comparable 2011 levels. Philadelphia, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San Francisco described sales as strong, while New York and Chicago reported some moderation in sales in September, after a fairly strong August. Kansas City and Dallas reported some softening or leveling off in sales. The Cleveland and Kansas City Districts noted that crossover SUVs have been selling well relative to less fuel-efficient vehicles. Sales of used vehicles were mixed, with San Francisco describing them as robust but New York and Cleveland characterizing them as flat.              Tourism was generally described as steady at robust levels, though there have been scattered indications of some softening. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis and San Francisco described tourism as strong, whereas the Kansas City and Dallas Districts indicated some signs of weakening. Even Districts reporting strength noted some pockets of softening: Boston reported a small drop in advance bookings, New York indicated a dip in activity in mid-September, Richmond noted a significant drop in government-sponsored bookings, and Atlanta mentioned disappointing cruise bookings and on-board spending. The Dallas District noted weakening travel demand from Europe and Asia; Atlanta also indicated weakening traffic from Europe but added that Canadian and Latin American visitors largely picked up the slack.       Real Estate and Construction        Residential real estate showed widespread improvement since the last report. All twelve Districts reported that existing home sales strengthened, in some cases substantially. Selling prices were steady or rising. Boston, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco noted declining or tight inventories, which have put upward pressure on prices. Modest price increases were reported in the New York, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts. New York and Richmond reported relatively strong demand at the high and low ends of the market, whereas Philadelphia and Kansas City noted relative strength for mid-range homes; Boston indicated a shift in the mix toward lower or medium priced homes. New home construction and sales were more mixed but still mostly improved: increased construction and/or new home sales were reported in the Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco Districts. Multi-family construction, in particular, was described as robust in the Boston, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas Districts. Residential rental markets continued to be characterized as strong, even in the New York and Atlanta Districts where rents increased somewhat less strongly than in recent months.              Commercial real estate markets were mixed since the last report. Office markets showed signs of softening in the northeastern Districts--Boston, New York and Philadelphia--with New York remarking on substantial new supply coming on the market in early 2013. In contrast, Atlanta, Minneapolis and San Francisco noted some improvement, while most other Districts reported stable or mixed market conditions. Industrial markets showed some strength in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland and Atlanta Districts, while conditions were described as sluggish in Richmond and mixed in St. Louis. Atlanta noted weakness in the market for retail space. Commercial construction activity was also mixed: Atlanta, Minneapolis and Kansas City reported some improvement in non-residential construction activity, while Richmond and Dallas noted that activity was sluggish.       Manufacturing        Conditions in the manufacturing sector were mixed since the last report, though on balance, more Districts reported that conditions had improved than worsened. The Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts reported that activity expanded, though growth was generally seen as modest. Activity was reported as mixed in the Dallas District, while the New York, Chicago, and Minneapolis Districts reported that activity weakened, though declines were mild for the latter two. Significant gains in manufacturing related to the construction, energy, and transportation sectors were reported across several Districts, with particularly robust gains tied to the automotive industry. There were exceptions in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts where manufacturing related to transportation equipment was reported as mixed.              Steel production was said to be flat in the Cleveland and San Francisco Districts, and lower in the St. Louis District. Activity related to machinery and equipment was reported as lower in the Philadelphia, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts. Weaker sales growth in the high tech industry was reported by Dallas, and Kansas City said that growth among high-tech firms remained sluggish in its District. The Boston District noted some weakness in the semiconductor industry, while the San Francisco District said that new orders from the semiconductor industry had improved. Manufacturing contacts in the St. Louis District were tentative about the outlook for 2013, and contacts in the Dallas District noted some uncertainty about the outlook due to the upcoming election.       Nonfinancial Services        Activity in nonfinancial services was stable to slightly stronger since the last report. The Richmond, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported that service-sector activity expanded, while such activity was reported as steady in the New York District and mixed in the Philadelphia District. Richmond noted that business activity strengthened for professional, scientific, and technical service firms, and Dallas noted strength in energy, accounting, and audit-related services. There was an increase in activity for a wide range of consulting services in the Boston and Minneapolis Districts. Activity related to health care was reported to be stable in the San Francisco District, but increased significantly in the Boston District. San Francisco reported continued sales growth for a wide variety of technology services, and noted that demand picked up for restaurants and other food-service providers.              Reports on goods transportation services generally remained positive. A pick up in such activity was noted in Cleveland, Atlanta, Richmond, and Dallas, while such activity was said to be flat in Kansas City. Contacts in the Cleveland, Atlanta, and Dallas Districts reported strong shipments of automotive, construction, and energy-related products. Port activity expanded to record levels in the Atlanta and Richmond Districts. Air cargo volume increased in the Atlanta District, but declined in the Dallas District due to weakness in the international sector.       Banking and Finance        Overall loan demand increased slightly on net since the last Beige Book report. New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and San Francisco reported stronger loan demand on balance, while Kansas City and Dallas reported flat demand and Chicago reported somewhat weaker demand. Most Districts reported an increase in mortgage lending, especially for refinancing purposes. New York, Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported some increase in demand for commercial and industrial loans, while demand for business loans was weak in Chicago and Dallas, and was characterized as mixed in Richmond. Demand for consumer credit, particularly for auto loans, was said to be strong in the Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, while consumer loan demand was more limited in New York, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City.              Credit standards were little changed since the last report. However, New York noted some tightening for consumer loans and residential mortgages, while Richmond and Chicago reported some easing for commercial and industrial loans. Still, loans remained difficult to obtain for many small businesses in the Cleveland, Richmond, and Chicago Districts. Banking contacts in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported stiff competition among lenders. Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas noted general improvements in loan quality, and delinquency rates generally held steady or declined in the New York, Cleveland, and Dallas Districts.       Agriculture and Natural Resources        Agriculture conditions were mixed since the last report. Drought conditions continued to hurt the agriculture sector in the Chicago District, parts of the Minneapolis District, and the Kansas City and Dallas Districts. However, agriculture activity was reported as higher in the Atlanta and St. Louis Districts, as well as in parts of the Minneapolis District, and was reported as stable in the San Francisco District. The Chicago and Dallas Districts noted that increased rainfall had improved crop conditions. In the Dallas District, crops were reported to be mostly in fair to good shape, with production levels ahead of last year but below average due to ongoing dry conditions. Producers in the St. Louis District reported that crops were generally in better condition than at the time of the previous report, and harvest rates for corn and rice were well ahead of their five-year averages. Contacts in the Atlanta District reported that the rise in some crop prices related to the drought in the Midwest led to an increase in crop production in the Southeast. Higher feed prices continued to adversely affect livestock producers in the Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco Districts, though the Chicago District noted some easing in higher feed prices which provided a bit of relief.              Activity in the energy sector remained strong, with the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts reporting robust gains in activity. The Minneapolis District reported that oil production hit a new record high in North Dakota, and the Cleveland District reported that oil and natural gas production held steady. Natural gas exploration was reported as lower in the Kansas City District and in parts of the Minneapolis District. Coal producers in the Cleveland District reported declines in production.       Employment, Wages, and Prices        Employment conditions were little changed since the last report. The Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts indicated that employment levels were flat or up slightly, with stagnant demand and uncertainty related to the upcoming presidential election, U.S. fiscal policy, and European debt issues cited by some as restraining hiring. The New York and Chicago Districts noted weaker labor market conditions, and conditions were described as mixed in Richmond. Firms in the St. Louis District reported an increase in hiring plans. Several Districts continued to report that employers were having difficulty filling highly skilled positions. In response, a few Districts noted that firms were starting to increase training programs to meet their staffing needs.              Most Districts reported that wage pressures remained modest since the last report, though an increase in the cost of employee medical benefits was noted in Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago. To the extent that wage increases were observed, they were concentrated among highly skilled workers in information technology, health care, professional services, and some of the skilled trades, according to reports from the Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts.              Price pressures were said to be contained as most Districts reported that both finished goods and input prices were little changed since the last report. Higher prices were cited by some Districts for agricultural commodities and petroleum-based products, although low or declining natural gas prices were reported in the Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Contacts in the Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts noted that drought conditions continued to result in higher feed prices. There were scattered reports of higher crop prices starting to show through to food prices at the consumer level. Atlanta reported an increase in corn and soybean prices, while Chicago and Kansas City reported that these prices declined somewhat. Slightly lower prices for some technology-related products were reported in the San Francisco District.",2012-10-10
86,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and based on information collected before November 14, 2012.  This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.          Economic activity expanded at a measured pace in recent weeks, according to reports from contacts in the twelve Federal Reserve Districts. Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco grew at a modest pace, while St. Louis and Minneapolis indicated a somewhat stronger increase in activity. In contrast, Boston reported a slower rate of growth. Weaker conditions in New York were attributed to widespread disruptions at the end of October and into November caused by Hurricane Sandy. Philadelphia reported general weakness that was exacerbated by the hurricane. However, in the Boston and Richmond Districts, the storm's effects were mostly limited. Contacts in a number of Districts expressed concern and uncertainty about the federal budget, especially the fiscal cliff.                  Among key sectors, consumer spending grew at a moderate pace in most Districts, while manufacturing weakened, on balance. Seven of the twelve Districts reported either slowing or outright contraction in manufacturing, and two others gave mixed reports. In some cases, such as high-tech equipment and steel production, an industry slowed in one District while strengthening in another. Several Districts reported slight gains in residential and commercial real estate. Travel and tourism varied by District; for example, Minneapolis contacts marked levels of activity above a year ago, and tourism fell in the Kansas City District. Non-financial services also differed among Districts, with Philadelphia businesses indicating softer demand, while firms in other Districts reported pockets of robust demand for professional, scientific, and technical services. In transportation, reports were, again, mixed. In addition, hurricane disruptions slowed freight shipments in some Districts, while simultaneously boosting demand for shipments of emergency supplies. In banking and financial services, higher demand for home mortgage loans and auto loans increased consumer lending in some Districts, although small business loan demand was generally described as weaker to only moderately higher. Credit quality improved on net.              Reports on agricultural conditions were mixed, as drought conditions persisted in several Districts, such as Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City; other areas reported solid production and, in some cases, increased investment. In the energy sector, extraction expanded on balance in San Francisco and activity remained at high levels in the Minneapolis and Dallas Districts. However, there were fewer active oil rigs in Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. In addition, coal production fell in the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts. Most Districts reported modest gains in hiring, while wage and price pressures remained mostly subdued. Employment increased in more than half of the twelve Districts. Wage growth was described as modest at best, constrained in part by an abundant labor supply. However, a few Districts reported pockets of strength in wage growth, notably in North Dakota, where oil drilling had pushed up demand for workers, and in the Kansas City District, where wages were rising for specialized workers in transportation, high-tech, and energy. San Francisco reported stronger wage growth for truck drivers and health-care workers. Price increases, for the most part, remained in line with the modest pace reported in our last assessment. Examples of some exceptions were input prices for construction in Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Richmond reported generally slower retail price increases, and in Chicago, retail food prices eased, except for meats. In contrast, Kansas City contacts indicated that retail prices had edged up.       Consumer Spending and Tourism  Consumer spending increased at a moderate pace in most Districts in recent weeks, with mixed reports from Dallas. In New York, sales were ahead of plan prior to Hurricane Sandy, and merchants expect to recoup sales lost during the storm as residents replace destroyed or damaged property. Philadelphia contacts reported slower growth since the last report. Apparel sales picked up in Boston, and Richmond indicated that home and garden stores reported stronger sales ahead of Hurricane Sandy. Durable goods sales varied across Districts. For example, Boston and Chicago noted an improvement in furniture, while sales in that category declined in Cleveland. Chicago reported flattening in electronics sales, whereas San Francisco contacts reported significant sales gains for consumer technology products.              Automobile sales varied by District, with Cleveland, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco indicating strength. Sales of both new and used vehicles in the San Francisco District were reported as running well above year-ago levels. Car sales were strong in Atlanta, although a bit less robust than earlier in the year. Richmond car sales were mixed. New York contacts said sales had flattened, and sales held steady in Kansas City. In contrast, auto sales slowed in Philadelphia and new vehicle sales fell at dealerships contacted by Chicago and Dallas. Sales of used vehicles were also mixed. Used car sales remained robust in New York and rose in Cleveland, with Cleveland District inventories remaining tight; in St. Louis, a majority of dealerships noted that used car sales had decreased relative to new car purchases, and in Minneapolis, used car sales softened.              Looking to the holiday sales season, the Districts whose contacts gave an outlook noted mostly upbeat expectations. New York retailers anticipated recovering lost sales during the holiday season, and in Philadelphia, expectations remained bright overall for holiday sales, despite somewhat less optimism among general retailers. Boston contacts indicated that they were positioning their businesses for increased internet sales, and a Richmond retailer commented that he was competing with his suppliers for online sales. While retailers anticipated a good holiday season in Minneapolis, mall contacts reported recent declines in traffic and sales. Contacts in Boston, Cleveland, and Chicago remarked on their uncertain sales expectations because of the potential for tax changes in 2013, as the national budget outlook remained uncertain.              Tourism slowed in some Districts while strengthening in others. New York District tourism was mixed prior to Hurricane Sandy; hotel bookings initially dropped off following the storm, but business bounced back the next week. In addition, late cancellation of the New York marathon likely brought large numbers of visitors to the city in early November. Hurricane Sandy affected areas of the Philadelphia District along the coastlines of Delaware and southern New Jersey, in some cases demolishing houses and devastating businesses. New Jersey also suffered losses in revenue from the closure of Atlantic City casinos and the cancellation or delay of conventions there; expectations were that most areas along the Jersey shore would be rebuilt and ready for the summer season. Richmond reported seasonally slower autumn bookings, along with scattered cancellations caused by Hurricane Sandy, and in the Kansas City District, tourism spending fell, leading to price reductions by hoteliers. In contrast, travel and tourism remained strong in Atlanta, with international visitors bolstering activity in Florida and District convention bookings picking up. The exception there was at cruise lines, for which bookings continued to fall below expectations. Travel and tourism rose in Minneapolis.       Nonfinancial Services  Reports from nonfinancial services providers differed among Districts. Boston reports were generally weaker than expected for tech services, while New York businesses indicated that the effects of Hurricane Sandy had negatively impacted both workers and customers. In the New York District, prolonged power and communications outages and extreme flooding hurt firms and residents, particularly on Long Island and in northern New Jersey. Slowing demand for nonfinancial services in the Philadelphia District was further hampered by the hurricane. St. Louis reported a net decline, but with expansion in some categories such as business support, telecommunications, casinos, legal, and crisis management services. Dallas noted steady demand overall, and contacts reported robust demand for insurance, audit, and legal services. However, Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco reported net expansion, with examples of growth at engineering, technology, and architectural firms. A number of contacts across Districts expressed uncertainty about business conditions for the months ahead as the firms and their customers waited for the outcome of federal budget negotiations.              Transportation sector activity was generally mixed since the last assessment. Dallas noted that intermodal cargo volumes were down. Declines in rail cargo volumes were led by such products as coal, metals, and forest materials. Atlanta also cited declines in coal shipments, due to softening global demand for metallurgical coal and less demand from domestic utility plants. Cleveland reported fewer freight shipments, which their contacts attributed to hurricane disruptions and weakness in Europe, even as freight demand was boosted by housing, motor vehicles, and retail. Kansas City also noted a pickup in trucking traffic due to emergency food shipments in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. Shippers in that District also reported an increase in their capital expenditures. According to contacts for the Dallas District, domestic airline demand was flat to down, and in the St. Louis District, air transportation firms announced plans to reduce operations.       Manufacturing Conditions in the manufacturing sector were mixed, though on balance, most Districts reported that conditions had weakened since the previous report. The Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts reported that activity had either slowed or declined somewhat, with most reports leaning toward the latter. Activity was mixed in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts, while reports from the Cleveland, Richmond, and St. Louis Districts were positive. The Boston, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts noted slower growth for information technology equipment, while business activity expanded at high-tech firms in the Kansas City District. Car and auto parts producers in the Atlanta District said that orders softened slightly. Similarly, auto production in the Cleveland District declined somewhat for domestic nameplates but increased for foreign nameplates. In contrast, heavy equipment and auto industries remained sources of strength in the Chicago and the Kansas City Districts. Demand was flat to down for transportation equipment in the Dallas District, and the Philadelphia District indicated that makers of primary metals, industrial machinery, and electronic equipment reported further declines.              Noteworthy gains in manufacturing related to the aerospace industry were reported in the Richmond and San Francisco Districts, while demand for aviation equipment held steady in Dallas. Steel production was down slightly in Cleveland, while the demand for steel in the San Francisco District improved a bit from low levels. Manufacturing contacts from five of the twelve Districts expressed concern about the outlook for 2013, in part, due to the uncertainty regarding the outcome of the fiscal cliff.       Real Estate and Construction Overall, markets for single-family homes continued to improve across most Districts with the exception of Boston and Philadelphia. Residential real estate markets in the New York District were mixed but generally firm prior to the storm. Selling prices were steady or rising. Boston, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas noted declining or tight inventories. The Cleveland District indicated that the number of single-family housing starts had increased since our last report and from a year ago; most sales contracts were in higher price-point categories. Similarly, Richmond noted more residential work in the high-end home category for the first time in three years, and builders cited significant pent-up demand in the first-time buyer segment. Atlanta indicated that existing home sales were up slightly compared to a year ago and reported that investors were more active in Florida than in the rest of the District. In Chicago, residential construction increased at a slow but steady pace in October and early November, and construction increased for single-family as well as multi-family homes. St. Louis reported that residential real estate market conditions continued to improve, and Minneapolis indicated that segments of construction and real estate were growing at a double-digit clip. Kansas City characterized residential real estate activity as brisk and noted that a solid rise in home sales had reduced home inventories. Dallas noted that single-family housing activity remained strong, with both new and existing home sales activity increasing. San Francisco reported that home demand continued to strengthen and that home sales continued to grow on a sustained basis in most areas, spurring new home construction. However, sales growth generally slowed for both the condominium and single-family home markets in the Boston District, and the Philadelphia District noted that October began as a disappointing month for some Realtors, only to be punctuated by Hurricane Sandy.              Construction and commercial real estate activity generally improved across Districts since the last report. Gains, albeit modest in most cases, were reported by Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, and Minneapolis. The gains among Cleveland's contacts were tempered by reports in recent weeks of a slowdown in inquiries and a decline in public-sector projects. Kansas City described activity as holding firm and noted that real estate markets remained stronger than a year ago. Demand for office and industrial space continued to increase in Dallas, although contacts at some businesses said they were ""holding back on expansions due to uncertainty."" Several Districts noted segments of little change in commercial real estate activity. Boston described market fundamentals as flat, and San Francisco depicted market conditions as stable but with pockets of strength for large infrastructure projects such as roads and bridges. Commercial and industrial conditions were mixed in the St. Louis District and throughout most of New York prior to the hurricane. New York added that, while office markets across upstate New York were unaffected by the storm, there were some signs of recent softening.       Banking and Financial Services Loan demand generally was either mixed or slightly stronger across most Districts in recent weeks. Among those noting mixed results, New York reported that demand for consumer and especially commercial and industrial loans weakened, but commercial and residential mortgage demand was steady. Richmond said that a small commercial banker was encountering a slight improvement in overall loan demand but added that consumer loans were unchanged from ""meager"" levels and small business loans were virtually non-existent. Chicago noted that small business loan demand experienced modest growth, but a decrease in credit demand occurred among middle-market customers. According to St. Louis contacts, overall lending activity was essentially unchanged over the period. St. Louis added that, while credit standards for commercial and industrial loans were largely unchanged, both the demand for these loans and the number of inquiries ranged from moderately lower to moderately higher. Used car loan demand was weak in the Dallas District, although first mortgage and energy-related lending increased. San Francisco cited weak-to-moderate business loan demand, but consumer lending expanded further with the help of auto loans and home mortgage refinancing; however, San Francisco noted that lending activity as a whole was unchanged. Most remaining Districts, including Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City reported moderate increases in total loan demand. In the Philadelphia District, banks reported widespread bank and ATM closings due to Hurricane Sandy.              Credit standards and credit quality were somewhat improved, on net, since the last report. Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City noted that credit standards on most types of loans were unchanged, and Dallas cited a loosening of credit standards, which contributed to very competitive loan pricing. Atlanta cited contacts who reported that underwriting standards had become more restrictive and burdensome since its last report, both in terms of credit scores and information requests. With respect to loan quality, New York reported that delinquency rates increased in the consumer and commercial and industrial segments but held steady in the residential and commercial mortgage segments. Philadelphia contacts cited moderate improvement. Cleveland and Richmond noted improvements in delinquency rates across consumer and business loan categories. Richmond added, however, that some contacts were concerned that banks were increasing their risk exposure by making longer-term loans in an effort to get higher yields. Kansas City and San Francisco also mentioned moderate improvement in loan quality.       Agriculture and Natural Resources Assessments of agricultural activity were mixed. Varying degrees of drought conditions persisted in several Districts, while Hurricane Sandy's agricultural damage was minimal and localized mainly in coastal areas. In the Atlanta District, much of Georgia experienced drought conditions, while Chicago reported that corn and soybean production in their District did not suffer as much from the drought as previously expected. Correspondingly, Minneapolis indicated that their District crop producers remained in mostly good shape, despite this year's drought. Low soil-moisture levels in the Kansas City District hindered winter wheat emergence, raising concerns that persistent drought could strain U.S. crop production, keep crop and feed prices high, and force further livestock herd liquidations. However, Richmond stated that most farmers in Virginia were relieved that Hurricane Sandy brought much needed rain without significant damage to the corn and soybeans still in the fields. San Francisco noted that production activity and sales of most crop and livestock products have been growing at a solid pace, as had investment spending on new production equipment. Moreover, the St. Louis District reported that harvest completion rates were considerably higher than the five-year average there.              Activity in the energy industry was generally mixed since the last report. Coal production was above year-ago levels in the St. Louis District but was lower in the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts. More electricity was being generated from natural gas in Kansas City. In the Atlanta District, Hurricane Sandy's damage to refineries and infrastructure in the Northeast caused southeastern regional refiners to increase production and transportation of oil products to supply affected areas. Minneapolis reported that oil and gas production remained at record levels but noted that exploration activity was flat to down in some areas since our last report. Similarly, extraction activity in the San Francisco District expanded on balance for petroleum and natural gas, although the number of rigs used for natural gas extraction fell as producers shifted their activities toward higher-valued oil formations. The number of active oil rigs also fell in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts. Minneapolis mentioned that iron mines in northern Minnesota remained busy, although production fell slightly compared to recent months.       Employment, Wages, and Prices Modest improvements in hiring activity were reported by most Districts. Labor markets were generally described as improving modestly by Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas. Staffing firms, according to Boston and Cleveland, experienced improved business conditions. However, Richmond reported that labor markets in general were weaker than in the last report, citing examples of soft demand and an unwillingness of some manufacturers to hire long-term unemployed workers. Contacts for Boston noted that demand for office and clerical assistants and accountants remained weak, and Cleveland reported that hiring across industries was generally sluggish except in autos. Atlanta indicated that employment agencies were seeing a pickup in orders for temporary help. Some large employers, however, announced plans to move toward hiring more part-time, rather than full-time, employees. Chicago reported that a number of firms were putting hiring on hold and had delayed temp-to-perm conversion decisions until next year. With respect to the upcoming holiday season, Cleveland reported that retailers were planning to hire the same number of temporary workers as last year, while Boston and Atlanta noted that some retailers were expecting to hire more help over the holidays. Finally, contacts in a number of Districts reported difficulties finding qualified workers in some specialized occupations.              Wage pressures were generally characterized as ""subdued"" or ""contained"" throughout much of the nation, according to the latest District reports. Virtually every District described wage growth as modest at best. Contacts in the Atlanta District attributed flatness in wages to the large number of applicants for newly posted positions. Richmond reported that manufacturing and retail wage growth edged up, but wage growth slowed at non-retail firms. In addition, non-labor costs were increasing in the Chicago District, mostly due to health-care costs. St. Louis cited stable wages but added that non-labor costs in manufacturing were rising. Minneapolis noted pockets of stronger wage growth in some geographical areas, such as North Dakota where oil drilling was pushing up demand for workers. However, even this pressure was easing in recent weeks. Kansas City noted strengthening in wage growth among specialized positions in transportation and high-tech firms. Finally, San Francisco noted that limited hiring and abundant labor supply were holding down wage and compensation increases. However, San Francisco added that a few cases of wage pressures were occurring among truck drivers, health-care workers, and entry level positions in areas with low unemployment.              As with wages, price pressures changed little from the modest pace that was reported in the last assessment. Almost every District described price growth as modest, although examples of higher price growth were occasionally cited. For example, Atlanta noted that, even though overall input price increases had eased, firms were being challenged by higher energy and crop-related input prices and by rising health-care costs. Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco all reported increasing prices of construction-related materials, and Chicago and Minneapolis also cited increases in metals prices. In addition, Kansas City remarked on rising prices in construction materials and manufacturing raw materials in general. Richmond reported increasing raw materials prices and slower increases in finished goods prices. Retail prices in general eased in the Richmond District, and Chicago noted that retail food prices eased, except for meats. According to contacts in the Kansas City District, however, retail prices edged higher. In the Richmond District, the pace of increases in services prices also moved up.",2012-11-28
87,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and based on information collected on or before January 4, 2013. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.            Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that economic activity has expanded since the previous Beige Book report, with all twelve Districts characterizing the pace of growth as either modest or moderate. Since the previous Beige Book, activity in the New York and Philadelphia Districts rebounded from the immediate impacts of Hurricane Sandy. Growth in the Boston, Richmond, and Atlanta Districts appears to have increased slightly, while the St. Louis District reports some slowing.                  All twelve districts reported some growth in consumer spending. Overall, holiday sales were reported as being modestly higher than in 2011, though sales were below expectations for contacts in many of the Districts. Auto sales were reported as steady or stronger in ten Districts. Citing concerns that consumers will spend cautiously due to ongoing fiscal uncertainty, retail contacts and auto dealers reported a slightly dimmer, though positive, outlook for future sales. Tourism activity was reported to have increased across much of the nation due to strong business and international travel, early snowfall in some ski areas, and a rebound in areas disrupted by Hurricane Sandy.              Activity among nonfinancial service sectors improved overall. Firms within the six Districts reporting on transportation services generally noted increased volumes. Manufacturing was mixed overall since the previous Beige Book; six Districts reported an expansion of activity and three reported a decrease. Among Districts reporting on their firms' near-term expectations, the manufacturing outlook remained generally optimistic; however, capital spending plans were less uniformly positive.              Since the previous Beige Book, real estate activity has expanded or held steady in eleven Districts for existing home sales and leasing; eight Districts for residential construction; eleven Districts for nonresidential sales and leasing; and nine Districts for nonresidential construction. Overall loan demand was steady in five Districts, rose in four, and fell in one. Credit standards were largely unchanged, except in two Districts where there were some signs of loosening. Six Districts reported improving credit quality and/or falling delinquency rates.              Although rain partially eased drought conditions for some agricultural regions in three Districts, reports of agricultural activity remained mixed. Districts reported that energy and mining sector activity was steady at high levels for most energy-related products but significantly weaker in coal production and coal-related investments.              Trends in wages, prices, and employment conditions were relatively unchanged in the Federal Reserve Districts. Input price pressures were reported to be steady overall with mixed reports for specific commodity prices in various Districts. Employment conditions were also little changed since the last report. However, hiring plans were more cautious for firms doing business in Europe or in the defense sector. Wage pressures were stable in all twelve Districts, though several Districts cited greater pressures for firms that reported difficulties finding qualified workers with specific skills.       Consumer Spending and Tourism        Since the previous Beige Book, consumer spending increased to some degree in all twelve Districts. Across the nation, holiday sales grew modestly compared with last year but came in below expectations in the New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts. Boston reported continued strong demand for clothing, shoes, and furniture, and San Francisco reported robust online sales. A major retail chain in New York indicated that sales picked up in early January. Retail sales were flat in Richmond except for gains in food and auto sales. Expectations for future sales were positive but mild, particularly in Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas where contacts cited the impact of fiscal cliff uncertainty on consumer spending.              Reports of auto sales were steady to stronger in ten Districts. Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco noted strong sales. New York and Dallas cited mixed sales that were generally positive, while auto sales in Kansas City slowed but remained higher than a year ago. Some dealers in the Chicago and Kansas City Districts reported high levels of inventory. Contacts in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas expect consumers to react to ongoing fiscal uncertainty, thus dimming a positive outlook for future sales. Chicago auto dealers were more upbeat, expecting stronger new car sales due to pent-up consumer demand, easing credit conditions, and rising used vehicle prices.              Tourism held steady or grew in all but one of eight reporting Districts. Coastal activity had fallen in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Sandy throughout most of the New York and Philadelphia Districts but has rebounded in all but the hardest hit areas. Boston, Atlanta, and San Francisco reported strong tourism in their Districts, with Boston and Atlanta citing business and international travel as strong contributors. Winter tourism activity in the Minneapolis District was strong in areas with snow, while Richmond reported normal winter activity in its District.       Nonfinancial Services        Overall, nonfinancial services have grown modestly since the previous Beige Book. Businesses in the New York and Philadelphia Districts recovered from the disruption of Hurricane Sandy. The Boston, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts reported positive growth among various service sectors, while the Richmond District reported stable to stronger demand for service firms. Boston reported strong demand for some health-care IT services and drug impact research, while San Francisco noted relatively weak demand for health-care services. Staffing firms in the Dallas District reported steady to slightly softened demand. Respondents remained optimistic about growth over the near-term in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts.              Transportation services were generally positive among the six Districts that reported. Freight transport shipping volume improved in the Cleveland District due to rising demand from the retail sector and areas affected by Hurricane Sandy. Atlanta reported increases in trucking tonnage and total railroad carloads, but low river levels caused delays in Mississippi River traffic. Reports from transportation services in the Dallas District were mixed, and most firms expect weak growth in the near-term. Trucking firms in the Richmond District reported a flattening in revenues; however, the District's port activity was boosted by ships diverted by Hurricane Sandy.       Manufacturing        Reports of manufacturing activity were mixed overall, with six Districts growing since the last Beige Book, three Distracts contracting, and two Districts reporting little or no change. Firms in the Boston and Chicago Districts reported continued expansion of activity at modest and moderate rates of growth, respectively. Overall activity once again appeared to expand in the San Francisco District, although it was mixed across sectors.  Gains in the aerospace and chemical sectors contributed to growth in the Boston and San Francisco Districts, as well as in the Dallas District. Manufacturing in the Chicago District grew with contributions from the auto and housing-related sectors. Manufacturing continued to expand, but at a more modest pace, in the Richmond District. Several firms cited falling export demand, especially from Europe.              In contrast to slight declines in the past Beige Book, firms in the Philadelphia and Minneapolis Districts reported slightly increased manufacturing activity. As in other Districts, product flowing into supply channels for auto production and housing construction contributed to Philadelphia's gains. Prior trends continued as firms in the New York District experienced little or no growth, except for the revenues of firms in the New York City area that recovered after Hurricane Sandy disruptions. Reports continued to be mixed among sectors in the Dallas District.               Manufacturing activity within the Cleveland and Atlanta Districts, and reported plans in the St. Louis District, declined somewhat--a trend reversal from the prior Beige Book. Contributing to the declines were steel and auto producers in Cleveland and makers of HVAC equipment, electric components, food, and automobile parts in St. Louis. Despite production gains in electrical equipment, appliances, and components, more pronounced contractions within the broad nondurable goods sector led to a continuation of declining activity in the Kansas City District.              Manufacturing firms' expectations of future activity were generally optimistic in the New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts; the level of optimism has significantly increased in the Philadelphia and Atlanta Districts since the previous Beige Book. Contacts in the Chicago District expect vehicle production to expand in 2013, while reports of activity from manufacturers in the St. Louis District have been negative on net. Boston District firms reported that capital spending was slow, except for select growth sectors. Capital spending was on track in the Cleveland District and was slowly increasing in the Chicago District. Looking ahead, Philadelphia District firms have significantly increased their capital spending plans, while the outlook in the Minneapolis District was reported as flat. In the Cleveland District, more contacts plan to reduce outlays than expand capacity.       Real Estate and Construction        Existing residential real estate activity expanded in all Districts that reported; growth rates were described as moderate or strong in nine Districts. Contacts in the Boston District attributed their strong sales growth to low interest rates, affordable prices, and rising rents. All Districts reporting on price levels saw increases; New York and Chicago reported only very minor increases. The five Districts that reported on housing inventories all reported falling levels. New residential construction (including repairs) expanded in all but one District of those Districts that reported. Contacts in the Kansas City District reported that increased lumber and drywall costs limited construction, causing a slight decline this period. Hurricane Sandy disrupted construction activity initially in New York, but this has since led to increased work for subcontractors on repairs and reconstruction.              Though a little weaker than residential real estate, reports on sales and leasing of nonresidential real estate are still mostly positive--described as modest on average. The Boston District reported a drop in leasing beyond normal seasonal trends; contacts cited fiscal cliff uncertainty as a factor. Minneapolis and Kansas City reported increased demand and tightening commercial real estate markets. Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Dallas all reported more modest increases in nonresidential real estate activity. Nonresidential construction is weaker than residential, with only slight to modest growth. The Boston District reported that demand for commercial real estate loans appears to be softening and that the pipeline for new construction projects has diminished significantly since the last report. Dallas reported that construction was expected to pick up in the commercial real estate sector in 2013.       Banking and Finance        Overall, loan demand was largely unchanged in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, with most of these Districts reporting a continuation of slight to moderate growth in total volume. The New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas Districts reported stronger demand than previously, while the St. Louis District reported a slight decline. Some increased lending in Philadelphia, Chicago, and Dallas was driven by businesses taking out loans for special year-end purposes such as tax planning and dividend payments. Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco all reported strong auto lending. Demand for residential mortgages improved in Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Commercial real estate lending was cited as a particular bright spot by New York, Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas. However, lenders in San Francisco remained reluctant to lend to real estate investors outside of the multifamily residential sector. San Francisco also reported a slight slowdown in IPO, venture capital, and private equity activity in that District's technology sector.              Banks in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts reported improvements in asset quality. Lenders were described as competing aggressively for highly qualified borrowers in Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco. In Atlanta, this stiff competition may be leading to loosening credit standards, as there was some indication that banks were more willing to increase their tolerance for risk. Chicago banks also reported some loosening of standards. On the other hand, lending standards remained largely unchanged in New York, Cleveland, and Kansas City.       Agriculture and Natural Resources        Reports of agricultural activity were mixed, although rain and mild temperatures delivered some relief from drought conditions to parts of the Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts. Low water levels along the Mississippi River also hampered transport for some contacts in the Chicago and Kansas City Districts. Despite the drought, some contacts in these Districts reported that farm income remained high with adequate crop insurance and historically high prices. Producers in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts expect ongoing dry conditions to hurt the winter wheat crop.              Activity in the energy sector had mixed reports. Production of oil and natural gas held steady at high--sometimes record--levels in the Cleveland, Richmond, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts. San Francisco reported that activity expanded to historic levels. Contacts in the Cleveland District reported that shale gas activity grew at a robust pace. In contrast, coal production has declined in the Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts since the previous Beige Book. Firms in the Atlanta District continue to plan investments, ranging from reserve development to increased refining and petrochemical operations to new pipeline infrastructure.       Employment, Wages, and Prices        Labor market conditions remained mostly unchanged in all Districts. The Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts all reported delayed hiring, often in defense manufacturing, due to fiscal cliff uncertainties. Companies in the Chicago District with trade or investment exposures to Europe reduced their hiring plans as well. Chicago reported that manufacturers are choosing to cut hours instead of reducing head count in expectation of production rebounds in 2013. Atlanta and Kansas City cited health-care policy changes and costs as another cause for minimal hiring. On the other hand, the New York, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts saw the labor market firming modestly. Finally, contacts in several Districts reported difficulties finding qualified workers in some specialized fields, such as skilled manufacturing, energy, and IT.              For those Districts that reported, wage pressures have been stable since the previous Beige Book and were most frequently described as contained or subdued. The San Francisco District reported modest wage pressures that were held down by an abundance of workers. The Richmond, Chicago, and Minneapolis Districts characterized wage growth as moderate. Specifically, business contacts in the Minneapolis District expected to increase wages 2 to 3 percent in 2013, while oil drilling companies in North Dakota and Montana expected higher increases. Several Districts reported wage pressures in sectors experiencing labor shortages, such as energy and IT. The New York and Chicago Districts reported higher year-end bonuses ahead of anticipated tax increases in 2013.              Overall, input price pressures appear to be stable. The Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported steady input prices, while Chicago reported decreasing raw materials prices. The New York, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts characterized input prices as slightly increasing; price pressures in these Districts were passed through to consumers somewhat in the form of higher finished goods prices. However, Chicago noted that businesses were unable to fully pass on meat and milk price increases to consumers. The Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts all cited rising prices for construction-related materials. Specifically, a Philadelphia builder noted that over the past 90 days these rising prices added about 3 percent to the cost of a new home.",2013-01-16
88,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and based on information collected on or before February 22, 2013. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.          Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that economic activity generally expanded at a modest to moderate pace since the previous Beige Book. Five Districts reported that economic growth was moderate in January and early February, and five Districts reported that activity expanded at a modest pace. The Boston District said the economy continued to expand slowly, and the Chicago District reported that economic activity grew at a slow pace.                  Most Districts reported expansion in consumer spending, although retail sales slowed in several Districts. Automobile sales were strong or solid most Districts, and tourism strengthened in a number of Districts. The demand for services was generally positive across Districts, most notably for technology and logistics firms. Transportation services activity was mixed among Districts, although the majority of contacts were optimistic about future activity. Manufacturing modestly improved in most regions, with several Districts reporting strong demand from the auto, food, and residential construction industries. Residential real estate markets strengthened in nearly all Districts and home prices rose amid falling inventories across much of the country. Commercial real estate activity was mixed or improved slightly in most Districts, and financing for commercial development remained widely available. Overall loan demand was stable or slightly higher across nearly all Districts, and several bankers noted stiff competition for qualified borrowers. Agricultural conditions varied across the country, with some areas continuing to suffer from drought while others reported considerable precipitation and improved soil moisture levels. Districts reporting on energy activity indicated modest expansions in crude oil and natural gas exploration, while mining activity slowed.              Price pressures remained modest, with the exception of increases in prices for certain raw materials and slightly higher retail prices in several Districts. Even with some input costs rising, most District contacts did not plan to increase selling prices. The majority of Districts reported modest improvements in labor market conditions, although hiring plans were limited in several Districts. Wage pressures were mostly limited, but some contacts reported upward pressure for skilled positions in certain industries due to worker shortages.       Consumer Spending and Tourism        Consumer spending expanded in most Districts, but several Districts reported mixed or lower activity among non-auto retailers. Sales strengthened in the Philadelphia and Richmond Districts, and retail sales were higher than a year ago in the Boston, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Districts. San Francisco reported modest growth in sales, Dallas noted flat to slightly higher sales activity, and New York said retail sales were strong in January but slowed in February primarily due to weather. The Chicago District said consumer spending increased at a slower rate, while Cleveland and Atlanta noted mixed sales activity. Kansas City said retail sales decreased since the previous survey period and were expected to remain flat in the months ahead. Many District contacts commented on the expired payroll tax holiday and the Affordable Care Act as having restrained sales growth. Many Districts noted rising gasoline prices and fiscal policy as having a negative effect on consumer sales, and contacts in the Boston, New York, and Minneapolis Districts said severe weather depressed sales somewhat. Contacts in several Districts reported a shift in sales activity from local malls to the Internet and indicated deep discounting among retailers was becoming increasingly common. San Francisco noted somewhat soft sales for traditional retail grocers, whose competition has increased from discount and online retailers.              Most Districts reporting on auto sales noted solid or strong increases in sales, with the exception of mixed activity in the St. Louis District and a seasonal slowdown in the Dallas District. Cleveland auto dealers credited milder-than-normal weather and pent-up demand for the robust sales growth. New automobile sales remained solid in the San Francisco District, driven by demand to replace older vehicles and low financing rates. Chicago and Minneapolis contacts reported an increase in activity for auto service departments due to inclement weather. Auto dealers in the Philadelphia District attributed the strong sales in New Jersey to the continued effect of Hurricane Sandy. The New York District reported wholesale and retail auto credit conditions as positive, with one contact noting increasingly aggressive lenders. Most Districts' contacts were cautiously optimistic about future auto sales.              Tourism remained solid or advanced further in most Districts, spurred by increased snowfall during the winter ski season. Travel was reported as robust in the New York District, particularly in Manhattan, as well as at hotels in the outer boroughs that are still occupied by displaced residents, utility workers, insurance adjusters, and others due to Hurricane Sandy. A ski resort in Minnesota reported that lift ticket sales and lodging were well ahead of last year, although not close to historical records. Boston and Atlanta noted a strong increase in international visitors, especially from Europe. Philadelphia said tourist activity was solid in the Poconos' ski resorts, but some revenues were lost when schools cancelled winter break to make up for missed days during Hurricane Sandy. Contacts in the Richmond District mentioned increased activity along the outer banks of North Carolina, and San Francisco reported solid growth of visitor counts and occupancy rates in Hawaii.       Nonfinancial Services        Nonfinancial services activity continued to grow at a modest pace since the previous Beige Book. St. Louis and San Francisco reported strong demand for technology, logistics, marketing and legal services. Logistics services were also an area of growth in the Philadelphia District, but growth was modest due to firms' concerns about possible federal spending cuts. High-tech services increased in the Kansas City District, but growth was lackluster in the Boston District due in part to weak demand from Europe and Japan. Staffing services firms in the Boston and New York Districts saw improved conditions, but activity was mixed in the Dallas District. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Kansas City services contacts continued to be optimistic about growth in the coming months and in the second half of 2013.              Transportation services activity was mixed. Shipping volume in the Cleveland District met or exceeded expectations, with increases driven by the energy sector, rerouting of container traffic, and residual effects from Hurricane Sandy. Transportation activity also increased in the Atlanta District, and port contacts continued to invest in infrastructure and equipment improvements. Kansas City transportation services activity was flat compared to the previous survey period. Dallas reported weakened transportation demand, with decreases in intermodal cargo, air cargo, and coal shipments, but contacts noted that petroleum and petroleum-product shipments increased during the survey period. Trucking firms in the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts had trouble finding experienced drivers, and a Cleveland contact said there may be a driver shortage in the summer. Expectations for future transportation activity were generally positive in most Districts.       Manufacturing        Manufacturing conditions improved in nearly all Districts, but the increases were generally modest. Boston, New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis and San Francisco reported some increases in factory activity, but the majority noted that the pace of recovery was slow. Conditions were mixed in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts, and manufacturing activity in the Kansas City District weakened. Contacts in the Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts cited concerns over government regulation and fiscal uncertainty as a reason for slow growth.              Auto production increased in the Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts, and a Minneapolis contact noted that production increased faster than expected, spurring plans to renovate their plant. Philadelphia and Dallas reported that food manufacturing activity also exceeded expectations during the current period. Manufacturing related to residential construction was a source of strength for many Districts, including wood product manufacturing in the St. Louis and San Francisco Districts; household goods manufacturing in the Chicago District; cement manufacturing in the Dallas District; and general housing construction product manufacturing in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Boston Districts. Primary and fabricated metal manufacturers in the Philadelphia District experienced a slowdown in activity, and a structural steel manufacturer in the Minneapolis District planned to close. Durable manufacturing was weak in the Kansas City District, but non-durablesespecially chemical manufacturingimproved. Expectations for future factory activity were generally more optimistic compared with the previous survey. Contacts in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts expected activity to improve over the next few months across a wide variety of industries.       Real Estate and Construction        Residential real estate activity continued to strengthen in most Districts, although the pace of growth varied. Contacts in the Boston, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts noted strong growth in home sales, while New York and Chicago reported slight improvements. A realtor in the Richmond District indicated that low interest rates continued to motivate home buyers, and potential buyers in the Philadelphia District expressed greater confidence, including entry-level purchasers who had been increasingly opting to rent since mid-summer. Contacts in the Cleveland and Atlanta Districts said sales were higher than a year ago. Home construction increased in most Districts, with the exception of the Kansas City District where it was reported as unchanged. Several Districts noted ongoing strength in multifamily construction, although contacts in the Atlanta and Cleveland Districts mentioned continued financing difficulties for builders. Home prices edged higher in the majority of Districts, with lower inventories generally cited as the primary cause. Richmond and Atlanta Realtors observed multiple offers on many homes. Philadelphia real estate contacts continued to report low-end home prices as firm or rising slightly, while high-end home prices were still falling. Inventories declined in nearly all Districts, with Realtors in several Districts concerned about the impact on future sales volume.              Overall commercial real estate conditions were mixed or slightly improved in most Districts. Commercial real estate activity grew modestly in the Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and St. Louis Districts, and activity in the San Francisco District expanded. Boston and New York reported mixed activity, while the Kansas City and Dallas Districts noted few changes. Although some modest growth was reported in the Chicago District, the level of activity remained weak, and commercial contractors in the Cleveland District noted a slowing in activity, particularly for defense-related projects. Office vacancy rates declined across most of the New York District, and industrial vacancy rates in upstate New York posted their lowest levels in three years. Richmond contacts described the supply of Class A office space as tight, which they attributed to the absence of new construction. Commercial development and leasing activity increased in the San Francisco Bay and Seattle markets, fueled by sustained growth in the technology sector. Commercial construction improved by varying degrees in the Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts. Respondents in the Boston District expressed concerns about overbuilding in Boston's apartment market and office sector, while Philadelphia contacts noted an increase in energy-related projects and repair work resulting from Hurricane Sandy. Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago reported high demand for manufacturing space, with some Chicago manufacturers leasing temporary space to accommodate increased demand. Credit for commercial development and transactions was widely available, although Boston noted a large decline in loan demand and contacts in the Cleveland District said financing difficulties continued.       Banking and Finance        Loan demand was steady or increased across all the Districts that reported. Residential real estate loan demand was strong in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta and Chicago Districts, mainly driven by refinances due to continued low interest rates. Demand for commercial real estate loans was also strong in the Cleveland, Richmond, and Kansas City Districts. Auto lending increased in the Cleveland and Atlanta Districts, and Philadelphia and Dallas cited growth in energy-related loan demand. San Francisco continued to report a slowdown in venture capital and private equity activity, but contacts noted an increase in the number of private technology companies moving toward an IPO.              Asset quality improved at banks in the Philadelphia, Kansas City and San Francisco Districts. Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta and San Francisco lenders reported high competition for qualified borrowers. Borrowing standards were reported to have been loosened in some Districts. Atlanta contacts noted additional loan capacity, but continued to be cautious with loan activity. Cleveland bankers considered cost cutting measures, including layoffs, due to shrinking net interest margins. New York contacts indicated a decrease in loan spreads for all loan categories, particularly residential mortgages, and bankers in the Chicago District said that very few mortgage originations were being kept on their balance sheets and that interest rate swaps were being utilized to hedge against a potential rise in interest rates. Bankers were generally optimistic about future activity in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts for the near term, but Atlanta bankers expected activity to ease toward the middle of the year.       Agriculture and Natural Resources        Agricultural conditions across the country varied with weather patterns. Persistent drought contributed to poor crop and pasture conditions in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts while recent precipitation improved soil moisture levels in the Atlanta and Chicago Districts. Richmond, St. Louis, and Minneapolis reported that elevated crop prices supported stronger farm incomes. Kansas City and Dallas indicated that drought-related herd reductions pushed cattle supplies to historical lows, and Chicago, Kansas City and Dallas reported weaker agricultural export activity. Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco noted additional farmland value gains due to robust demand from both farmers and nonfarm investors. Chicago reported that congestion issues in barge traffic eased on the Mississippi River.              Energy activity remained mixed with modest expansions in crude oil and natural gas exploration but slower mining activity. Drilling activity for crude oil and natural gas expanded further in the Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts and was steady in the Richmond and Dallas Districts. Future drilling activity was expected to rise in the Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts, and Atlanta noted capital spending at Gulf of Mexico ports was expected to increase export capacity for oil refineries. In contrast, coal production fell in the Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts, and was expected to decline further with a shift in demand toward low-priced natural gas and stricter environmental regulations. Minneapolis reported a slowdown in metal mining activity, and some facilities planned to further reduce production later in the year. Ethanol production declined in the Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts but edged up in the Chicago District.       Employment, Wages, and Prices        Labor market conditions generally improved, although several Districts reported restrained hiring. Many Districts reported a rise in temporary employees, while staffing contacts in the Boston District noted an increase in the placement of permanent and temporary-to- permanent workers. Auto dealers in the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts mentioned plans to hire more workers, and Dallas noted robust hiring activity for experienced corporate, energy, and intellectual property lawyers. Positions in the manufacturing industry increased in the New York, Richmond, and Chicago Districts, although several Chicago manufacturers expressed plans to either invest in more productive capital or adjust the hours of existing employees prior to hiring new workers. St. Louis noted weakness in healthcare services and information technology positions, and Cleveland reported reduced hiring plans from commercial builders and coal operators. Employers in several Districts cited the unknown effects of the Affordable Care Actas reasons for planned layoffs and reluctance to hire more staff. Wage pressures were minimal in most Districts, but contacts reported some upward pressure for several skilled positions as a result of higher demand. Some Districts indicated a shortage of skilled workers such as engineers, truck drivers, software developers, and technical jobs, and Atlanta noted a lack of compliance specialists due to heavier regulations in the healthcare industry.              The majority of Districts reported that price pressures remained modest, but some input costs continued to rise. Cleveland and San Francisco noted an increase in prices for petroleum- based products such as gasoline, fertilizer and certain plastics, and contacts in the Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts commented on increased transportation and fuel costs. Builders in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts cited an increase in construction material costs, particularly for lumber, drywall, and steel. Retail prices were steady or slightly rising in most Districts, although Richmond noted some slowing since the last report. Chicago retailers reported modest wholesale price increases for a number of products, with larger increases for meat, fresh produce, and leather. Retail grocers in the San Francisco District reported relatively stable prices overall, but weather-related factors boosted fresh produce prices. Increased food costs pushed up restaurant menu prices in the Kansas City District, and restaurant owners expect these costs to remain elevated. Atlanta service industry contacts noted that stronger sales were likely to put upward pressure on prices over the next year. Plans to increase selling prices were limited among most District contacts.",2013-03-06
89,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas based on information collected on or before April 5, 2013. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.          Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest overall economic activity expanded at a moderate pace during the reporting period from late February to early April. Activity in the Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts was characterized as growing at a moderate pace, while the Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts noted modest growth. The New York and Dallas Districts indicated that the pace of expansion accelerated slightly since the previous Beige Book.                  Most Districts noted increases in manufacturing activity since the previous report. Particular strength was seen in industries tied to residential construction and automobiles, while several Districts reported uncertainty or weakness in defense-related sectors. Consumer spending grew modestly, and firms in some Districts cited higher gasoline prices, expiration of the payroll tax cut, and winter weather as factors restraining sales growth. Retailers in several Districts expect continued sales growth in the near term. Overall vehicle sales remained strong or increased, but sales of used automobiles declined in some Districts. Travel and tourism expanded across most reporting Districts, boosted by both business and leisure travel.              Demand for nonfinancial services increased at a modest pace, and several Districts noted growth in freight and transportation services. Most Districts said residential and commercial real estate improved markedly since the last report. Home prices were rising in many areas of the country. Loan demand was steady to slightly up in most Districts. Reports on agricultural conditions were mixed, as drought or cold weather adversely impacted some Districts while others reported a strong agricultural sector. Oil and natural gas activity remained robust over the reporting period, with contacts in the Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts expecting a rise in activity in coming months, while coal production continued to decline.              Employment conditions remained unchanged or improved somewhat, and reports of hiring were most prevalent in the manufacturing, residential construction, information technology, and professional services sectors. Wage pressures were generally contained, although several Districts cited upward pressures in occupations experiencing labor shortages, such as information technology, construction, and engineering. Aside from reports of increases in home prices and residential construction materials, price pressures remained mostly subdued across Districts.              Outlooks among respondents remained optimistic across sectors and Districts, with growth mostly expected to continue at the same or a slightly improved pace. Some uncertainty remained, primarily regarding fiscal policy and health care reform.       Manufacturing        Manufacturing activity held steady or increased in most Districts since the previous Beige Book. The pace of growth picked up in the Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, while the Richmond and Chicago Districts noted that the pace of growth in production was slower than earlier this year. Contacts in the Boston District reported mixed conditions, and manufacturing activity held steady in the New York District. Manufacturing conditions in the Kansas City District continued to soften, driven by weaker durable goods production, although factory managers project a rebound in coming months. Firms in the New York, Philadelphia, and Dallas Districts were broadly optimistic about prospects for 2013, while cautious optimism was expressed by manufacturers in the Cleveland District, and mixed outlooks were expressed in the Boston District. Contacts in the Atlanta District do not expect future production to be as high as previously projected.              Strength in residential construction spurred manufacturing increases in several Districts. There were widespread reports of growth in demand for wood products; a contact in the Philadelphia District noted the best growth prospects in five years, a sawmill in Montana restarted production after idling for more than four years, and a Dallas District lumber firm noted a seasonal demand increase for the first time in several years. The auto industry remained a source of strength for several Districts, including Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis. Gains were reported by food manufacturers in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts, and food contacts in the St. Louis and Dallas Districts plan to expand operations or make significant capital expenditures. In the Cleveland District, suppliers to the shale gas industry cited strong activity, and increased activity in natural-gas related industries was seen in the Chicago District. Electronic equipment and instruments manufacturers in the Philadelphia District and high tech firms in the Kansas City District noted gains over the reporting period, while reports on high tech orders in the Dallas District were mixed across customer groups, and semiconductor firms in the Boston District said sales continued to languish.              Numerous Districts reported uncertainty or weakness in military or defense-related sectors. San Francisco District defense-related manufactures noted furloughs, layoffs, and plant closures at some production facilities, and military customers in the Chicago District were taking measures to lower costs in anticipation of tighter future defense budgets. Lower activity was indicated by makers of primary metals in the Philadelphia District, and Chicago District specialty metal manufacturers noted declines in new orders. Demand for steel was relatively flat in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts, while firms in the San Francisco District saw an increase in demand for steel products used primarily in transportation infrastructure and nonresidential construction projects. Reports from fabricated metals producers were mixed across Districts, with increases noted in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts while weaker production was noted in the Kansas City District.       Consumer Spending and Tourism        Most Districts reported increases in retail spending. Firms in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts noted sales increased at a modest to moderate pace. Most retailers in the Boston District said demand was slower than expected. Sales activity was mixed according to the Atlanta District's report, and retail spending declined in the Richmond and Chicago Districts. Demand for apparel rose in the Boston, Cleveland, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, and sales of furniture and appliances in the Chicago District were buoyed by improvements in the housing market. Sales of electronics rose in the Cleveland District, and the San Francisco District report indicated strong demand for mobile computing devices. Contacts in some Districts cited higher gasoline prices, expiration of the payroll tax cut, and winter weather as factors restraining sales growth. Looking ahead, retailers in several Districts expect modest sales growth in the near term. In particular, the St. Louis District reported new store openings, and some retailers in the Dallas District said they have added employees in line with expanding operations.              Overall, automobile sales remained strong or increased moderately since the last report. The exception was a slight decline in sales of used vehicles in the New York and Cleveland Districts. A number of contacts in the St. Louis District reported plans to open new dealership locations, and dealers in the Chicago District were building inventories for the spring selling season. Used vehicle prices remained high. Outlooks were mostly positive, and contacts in the Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts expect sales to increase in coming months. However, some auto dealers in the Cleveland District expressed concern about the potential negative impact of fiscal policy on consumer spending.              Reports from most Districts pointed to continued strength in travel and tourism, bolstered by both the business and leisure segments. Business travel remained robust in the Boston, Atlanta, and Minneapolis Districts, and foreign visitors continued to boost convention travel according to the Atlanta District. The Minneapolis District noted that winter tourism activity was stronger than last year, and spring-break related travel bolstered tourism in the Richmond District. Restaurants in the Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts noted increased sales. Bookings were strong at some resorts in the Philadelphia and Richmond Districts, and hotels in Manhattan, Hawaii, and the Kansas City District noted solid gains in occupancy rates. In contrast, business at restaurants and museums in the Boston District softened in part due to unfavorable weather conditions. Attendance and revenues were slightly lower at Broadway theaters, casino revenues fell in the Philadelphia District, and tourism activity weakened in Southern California during the reporting period.       Nonfinancial Services        Demand for nonfinancial services expanded at a modest pace since the previous report. The Kansas City and San Francisco Districts noted solid growth in information technology services, and contacts expect demand to remain robust through year-end. The Boston District reported strong demand for healthcare consulting services partly due to changes resulting from the Affordable Care Act, while healthcare firms in the San Francisco District indicated plans to freeze hiring and scale back capital expenditures in response to federal spending cuts. Defense-related and other firms dependent on the federal government in the Philadelphia District said they expect a decline in activity for the remainder of the year.              Activity expanded for professional and business services, such as accounting, advertising, marketing, consulting, and legal services. Consulting services remained strong in the Boston District, and firms in the Dallas District noted strength in accounting services. Advertising and marketing firms in the Boston District said an uptick in growth for their services was buoyed by stronger financial positions of clients. The St. Louis District noted plans for hiring and expansion in social and legal services, while the Dallas District report indicated weaker-than-expected growth in demand for legal services.              Transportation service activity increased since the previous report. Air travel improved in the Dallas District, in part due to spring-break related activity. Intermodal cargo volumes moved higher in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts, and activity at logistics and transport firms in the Philadelphia District grew at a moderate rate. Trucking traffic picked up in the Kansas City District, and trucking cargo volumes were above year ago levels according to Atlanta's report. Railroad contacts in the Dallas District said shipments grew, particularly for petroleum and construction-related products, and freight transportation volumes were higher than expected in the Cleveland District. According to Richmond's report, container traffic increased at larger ports in the District because of continued strength in shipments of auto parts. Air freight volumes rose in the Atlanta District, and small parcel shipments grew strongly in the Dallas District. However, railroad shipments were flat to slightly down in the Atlanta District, and a contact in the Richmond District said that European-bound vessels were leaving the port lighter than in the past, particularly due to a decline in construction and agricultural equipment exports.       Real Estate and Construction        Residential real estate activity continued to improve in most Districts, and some Districts, including Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco, noted increased momentum since the last report. The New York District, in particular, noted especially strong improvement in residential real estateboth in for-sale housing and apartment markets.              Home sales continued to rise in most Districts. Although homebuyer demand was high in the Boston District, low home inventories were restraining sales, keeping growth modest. Home sales were reportedly strong in both the Atlanta and Dallas Districts. The Richmond District noted low inventories were pushing up contracts to well above listing prices, and the Boston and New York Districts said multiple bids on properties have become more common. Tight inventories and strong sales led to rising home prices in many Districts, including Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Within the New York District, condo sales volumes strengthened and low inventories have begun to drive up selling prices in New York City and surrounding areas, while New Jersey home prices were rising modestly and inventories were shrinking with a marked reduction in the number of distressed properties. Contacts in the Boston District also noted a decline in the stock of distressed properties.              New home construction continued to pick up in most Districts, although the Richmond District said that a low supply of residential building materials had stalled construction. Only the Philadelphia District noted that residential construction decelerated somewhat, although home sales were still growing moderately. Multifamily construction increased in several Districts including Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco. The New York District noted apartment rents accelerated in early 2013, due to stronger demand coupled with historically low inventories. The Cleveland, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts said apartment demand remained strong.              Commercial real estate and construction activity improved in most Districts. Office vacancy rates declined in the Boston District and contacts said the construction of mixed-use projects was picking up. The New York District reported that office vacancy rates continued to decline and rents rose in Manhattan. The Philadelphia District commented that there was not much change in nonresidential activity during the reporting period, but that contracts for repair work from Hurricane Sandy have yet to be approved. Contacts in the Richmond District cited a tight supply of class A office space and said there were several large projects under construction in the Washington D.C. area. Commercial construction saw widespread improvement with the New York, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts noting increases. Both commercial real estate development and leasing activity increased across the San Francisco District, mostly fueled by growth in the technology industry. Several Districts, including Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, and Kansas City said commercial property investment sales activity increased during the reporting period.              Contacts in the Philadelphia and Kansas City Districts were somewhat optimistic in their outlooks for the commercial real estate and construction markets in general, but contacts in the Cleveland District were cautious about near-term construction activity. Dallas District contacts said office and warehouse markets were improving, and Atlanta District respondents noted growing optimism for the office and industrial sectors.       Banking and Finance        Loan demand was steady to slightly up at most District Banks that commented on lending. The Philadelphia District, however, said loan volumes softened somewhat since the previous report. The New York District noted widespread increases in loan demand, particularly for commercial loans and residential mortgages, and the Cleveland District said business and consumer loan demand picked up since the last report. The Dallas District saw broad-based improvement in loan demand as energy-related lending remained strong and commercial real estate and home equity lending bounced up from low levels. The San Francisco District said increased growth in automobile and mortgage loans spurred overall improvements in loan demand. Several Districts, including Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco, said loan pricing was very competitive.              Reports on mortgage lending were mostly favorable. Stronger refinancing activity was cited by the New York and Atlanta Districts. The Cleveland and Kansas City Districts noted a shift from mortgage refinancing to new purchases, and the New York, Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported an uptick in residential mortgage loans.              Most District banks said credit conditions remained favorable, with improved credit quality for business and consumer loans.       Agriculture and Natural Resources        Agricultural conditions were mixed across Districts, largely due to varying weather patterns. Drought persisted in the Kansas City District and worsened slightly in the Dallas District, straining the respective winter wheat crops and causing continued losses in the livestock sector. However, drought conditions improved significantly in much of the Atlanta District, and the winter wheat crop in the St. Louis District was largely in good condition. Cold weather delayed field preparation for spring planting in the Richmond and Chicago Districts. The Minneapolis District's agricultural sector remained strong, and producers in the San Francisco District noted increased production as well as higher demand. Farmers in the Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Districts plan to increase soybean acreage this year but were mixed in their plans for corn and other grain acreage. Contacts in the Chicago District noted that corn and soybean prices dropped over the reporting period based on expectations of a larger crop this year and current stocks not being as tight as anticipated.              Oil and natural gas production generally held steady at moderate to high levels since the last report. Drilling activity was stable over the reporting period, but contacts in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts expect a rise in coming months. Output in some wet gas regions of the Cleveland District is expected to increase later in the year as new gas processing units come online. The energy sector was a bright spot in the Atlanta District, as projects to increase the Gulf Coast's liquefied natural gas (LNG) export capacity drove capital and labor demand. Across the country, coal production continued to decline, with lower output reported by the Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts.       Employment, Wages, and Prices        Labor market conditions remained unchanged or improved slightly, and reports of hiring were more widespread in the manufacturing, residential construction, information technology, and professional services sectors. Several Districts noted robust demand for workers tied to the residential construction sector, including Philadelphia, Cleveland, Dallas, and San Francisco. In particular, a lumber and wood products firm in the Philadelphia District said the firming housing market had resulted in the best growth prospects in five years. Demand for information technology professionals and engineers was strong in the New York, Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. Staffing firms in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts noted an increase in orders from the manufacturing sector, and several manufacturers in the St. Louis and Kansas City Districts said they planned on expanding their payrolls. Reports from the New York and Richmond Districts indicated strong demand for temporary workers. The Minneapolis District noted a tightening labor market, and along with the Dallas District cited continued challenges in attracting and retaining workers in areas close to oil-drilling regions. The Chicago District cited a stronger job market for new college graduates and more competition among employers to fill intern positions. Contacts in several Districts faced difficulties finding highly trained or skilled workers, especially in the information technology and engineering fields. In contrast, hiring activity was limited in the Boston and Cleveland Districts, demand for staffing services softened in the Dallas District, and some Districts, including Richmond and Atlanta, reported restrained hiring due to uncertainty over fiscal policy or healthcare reform.              Overall upward wage pressures continued to be fairly modest. There were a few exceptions, however. Several Districts reported wage pressures in sectors experiencing labor shortages, such as information technology, construction, and engineering. The Kansas City District noted wage increases for commercial truck drivers, and the Richmond District reported widespread wage increases in the service sector. Rising healthcare costs were a concern among contacts in a few Districts, including Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago.              The majority of Districts said overall price pressures remained minimal during the reporting period. Several Districts, including Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco, said prices for some construction materials rose since the last report, but there were few reports of pass-through.              Kansas City District contacts said price increases for raw materials used in manufacturing led to higher selling prices in some instances and retail prices edged up. New York District respondents noted some increased selling prices in the service sector, and the Atlanta District reported that contacts in the transportation sector were able to cover cost increases with fuel surcharges. The Atlanta and Dallas Districts said that cotton prices rose since the last report.              Contacts in the Richmond District noted input and finished goods prices rose at a slower pace since the last report, and Chicago District contacts said commodity prices were down slightly.",2013-04-17

In the Philadelphia District, manufacturers reported that orders and shipments have fallen somewhat, and in the Richmond District, manufacturing activity softened since the previous report, although there were scattered reports of improvement. Most firms in the Boston District are reasonably optimistic about the outlook, and many contacts in the Cleveland District believe that business conditions will continue to improve slowly during the second half of the year. However, the near-term outlook has waned somewhat in the New York District.              Continuing a theme from the previous report, strength in residential construction was a boon to manufacturers who supplied that industry. Firms in the Philadelphia District supplying the home-building sector reported strong orders, and the Cleveland District noted that suppliers to residential construction were among those seeing the strongest activity, while the Richmond, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts all reported increased demand for lumber or wood products. Growth in the auto industry was noted by the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts, although the Chicago District reported that the auto industry grew at a more moderate pace.

Retailers in the New York District reported that sales were tepid in April but picked up in May. Meanwhile, the Richmond District noted that sales were flat during the reporting period. The Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Minneapolis Districts reported that late winter weather slowed retail sales; the Chicago District noted that sales picked up once warmer weather arrived.

The Kansas City District reported that appliance purchases were particularly strong. Inventories were generally at desired levels in the New York and Chicago Districts. The outlook for retail spending was positive in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts, while more cautious expectations were noted in the Boston, Cleveland, and St. Louis Districts.              Vehicle sales generally increased moderately across Districts. The New York, Richmond, and San Francisco Districts reported that sales remained strong or at high levels.

More respondents to a St. Louis District survey indicated that inventories were too high than too low. The Philadelphia, Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts noted that the outlook for future sales was generally positive.              Tourism showed signs of strength in several Districts. The Boston District reported increased tourism revenues but noted that attendance at museums and attractions was down, perhaps due to weather affecting leisure travel plans. The New York District noted that tourism activity was mixed but fairly robust since the previous report. The Richmond District reported that unseasonably cool weather negatively affected some resorts. Leisure and international travel continued to experience healthy demand in the Atlanta District. Extended winter weather boosted skiing in parts of the Minneapolis District. The San Francisco District reported that travel and tourism activity in Hawaii was robust, while activity in southern California declined a bit. Hotel occupancy and room rates were higher in the Atlanta and Kansas City Districts. Advanced bookings and the overall outlook for summer travel were optimistic, but the San Francisco District noted some concern that the flow of international visitors could taper off in coming months due to potential weakness in the global economy.

The Cleveland District noted strong activity, while both import and export traffic increased in the Richmond District. The Atlanta District reported increased movement of petroleum products and wood products but decreased shipments of grain products, metallic ores, military machinery, and transportation equipment. The Dallas District saw increased cargo and container volumes. The Kansas City District reported slower transportation activity due to poor weather conditions. Minneapolis District contacts expected small increases in freight traffic in the second half of the year.       Real Estate and Construction        Residential real estate and construction activity increased at a moderate to strong pace in all Districts. Several Districts reported that higher demand and low inventory of homes available for sale are resulting in multiple offers on properties. Almost all Districts reported higher home sale prices.

Foreclosed properties available for sale have declined significantly in the San Francisco District. The rental market remains tight with noticeable increases in rental rates in the New York District. Residential construction increased across all of the reporting Districts. Several Districts noted increases in multifamily projects. The Minneapolis District reported that many markets saw huge percentage increases in building permits from a year ago. Builders are cutting back on discounting in the Cleveland District. The Richmond District noted that increased construction has pushed up the price of building lots, and the Atlanta District reported that the lack of available lots has constrained building activity. The Philadelphia District commented that builders are facing problems, as the long housing recession has disrupted the supply chain for materials and the pool of skilled workers.              Commercial real estate and construction activity expanded at a modest to moderate pace in most Districts. The New York District reported that the Manhattan market is particularly robust. The Chicago District noted that an increase in demand for leasing was pushing up commercial rents, with strong demand from the health care sector. However, a market in the Boston District indicated no change in commercial rents or vacancy rates since the previous report. A market in the Richmond District had more hotels complete construction, and retail space was absorbed at a faster pace. Commercial construction continues to expand. The Philadelphia District said that most construction activity is related to ongoing demand for industrial warehouse space, higher education facilities, and public utility infrastructure. The Atlanta District reported that most activity was coming from build-to-suit projects. The Dallas District noted an increase in office building construction. The Cleveland District said that many projects are in development, but new inquiries are weak.

The New York and Cleveland Districts reported widespread decreases in delinquency rates for business and consumer loans. Several Districts reported that credit standards have not changed much since the previous report.       Agriculture and Natural Resources        Agricultural conditions remained mixed across Districts, as weather patterns varied. Recent rains brought drought relief to the Atlanta, Chicago, and Minneapolis Districts but delayed or slowed plantings in the Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts. Meanwhile, drought conditions worsened in the Dallas District, and contacts in the San Francisco District remained concerned that limited water availability in parts of the District could pass through to lower seasonal hiring and reduced agricultural output in coming months. Farm incomes increased in the Minneapolis District, while farm income growth softened in the Kansas City District. Well over 90 percent of the St. Louis District's winter wheat crop was rated in fair or better condition, but winter wheat crop conditions deteriorated further in the Kansas City District, with much of the crop in relatively poor condition.

The New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts cited examples of contacts reporting difficulty finding qualified people to fill vacancies. The Richmond and Cleveland Districts noted that new hours of service regulations may exacerbate difficulty finding truck drivers. A number of Districts reported solid demand for workers in information technology, health care, and engineering.

The Philadelphia and Cleveland Districts reported increased costs for health insurance.              Districts reported level prices to mild price increases. The Boston District reported that aside from food, input prices were generally unchanged, although a few manufacturers have raised their own prices. Manufacturers in the Richmond District indicated that finished goods prices grew at a somewhat quicker pace. The Kansas City District reported that while finished goods prices remained fairly flat, manufacturers planned to raise finished good prices over the next few months to partially offset higher input costs. However, most firms in the Atlanta District continued to report having little pricing power, and the Chicago District noted that pass-through to downstream prices remained limited. The Philadelphia and Cleveland Districts reported higher construction materials prices. Meanwhile, the San Francisco District noted that prices for cement, logs, and lumber edged up, while prices for wood products, steel, and some metals declined. Gasoline prices spiked higher in the Minneapolis District, and several Districts noted that natural gas prices increased since the previous report. The Dallas District reported that most contacts expect price increases to remain modest for the remainder of the year.",2013-06-05

Residential construction activity also improved moderately across the Districts, and contacts in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco reported faster growth in multi-family construction, in particular.              Commercial real estate market conditions continued to improve across most Districts. New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco reported modest to moderate improvements in nonresidential real estate activity. Dallas reported strong growth in leasing activity for office and industrial space. Boston and Richmond reported that commercial real estate conditions were holding steady or improving, depending on location. Nonresidential construction activity was stable or increased throughout the nation. Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Richmond reported that commercial construction was flat to slightly up, while Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas noted improvements in commercial construction.       Banking and Finance Reports on banking conditions were generally positive across the Districts. Overall loan demand increased modestly across most reporting Districts. New York District bankers reported mixed but generally steady loan demand. Some bankers in the Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas Districts noted competitive pressures to reduce loan pricing. Bankers in the Philadelphia, Richmond, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts noted a shift toward new home mortgages and away from refinancing (which was led, in part, by increases in interest rates).              Reports on credit quality indicated slight to moderate improvements across the reporting Districts. Improvements were noted by the New York, Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Credit standards remained largely unchanged, although some bankers in the Atlanta and Philadelphia Districts noted increased competition to ease credit standards.       Agriculture and Natural Resource Industries Agricultural conditions varied across the Districts because of differing weather conditions. Crop conditions improved in the Chicago and St. Louis Districts, while agricultural production increased in the San Francisco District and is expected to improve in the Kansas City District. Extremely wet conditions delayed planting and even resulted in some farmers in the Richmond and Minneapolis Districts planting soybeans instead of corn. Excessive rains in the Richmond District also damaged the wheat crop in some areas. Contacts noted persistent drought conditions in some areas of the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts and in most of the Dallas District. Winter wheat harvest output yields were highly variable because of crop damage from freezing and drought in the Dallas and Kansas City Districts. The condition of pastureland in the Atlanta and St. Louis Districts improved since the previous report.              Coal production was lower compared with the same time last year for the Cleveland, St. Louis, and Richmond Districts. Energy activity remained robust or steady at high levels in the Atlanta and Dallas District. Natural gas production was stable in the Cleveland District and continued to increase in the Richmond District. Drilling declined in the Cleveland District, was flat in the Kansas City District, and increased in the Richmond District. Oil and gas exploration was up slightly in the Minneapolis District. Mining was flat in the Kansas City District, weakened in the Chicago District, and was sluggish in the Minneapolis District.       Employment, Wages, and Prices Hiring held steady or increased at a measured pace in most Districts. Contacts in the Philadelphia, Richmond, and Chicago Districts were cautious or reluctant to hire permanent or full-time staff. The Richmond and Chicago Districts noted relatively stronger demand for part-time workers. Transportation contacts in the Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts noted some difficulty finding qualified drivers. Contacts in the New York, Richmond, and San Francisco Districts reported high demand for technology workers.              Most Districts reported that wage pressures remained limited or contained. The Chicago and Minneapolis Districts reported moderate wage pressures. The Chicago District noted that rising healthcare and other benefit costs were being passed onto employees. Contacts in the New York and San Francisco Districts noted that competition for technology workers had an effect on salaries. The Richmond District noted that wage growth picked up in the manufacturing sector, remained robust at non-retail establishments, and flattened at retail businesses.              Overall consumer and input price pressures remained stable or modest in most reporting Districts, although some Districts noted price increases. Most notably, the Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts noted upward pressures on the prices of construction materials. The Philadelphia and Richmond Districts reported price increases for raw materials and finished goods among manufacturers. The New York District reported that input price pressures have abated further in manufacturing but remained widespread in services. Retail prices remained steady in the Boston, New York, Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas District, while retail price growth slowed in the Richmond District and wholesale retail prices increased in the Chicago District.",2013-07-17
92,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and based on information collected on or before August 26, 2013. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.          Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that national economic activity continued to expand at a modest to moderate pace during the reporting period of early July through late August. Eight Districts characterized growth as moderate; of the remaining four, Boston, Atlanta, and San Francisco reported modest growth, and Chicago indicated activity had improved. Consumer spending rose in most Districts, reflecting, in part, strong demand for automobiles and housing-related goods. Activity in the travel and tourism sector expanded in most areas. Demand for nonfinancial services, including professional and transportation services, increased slightly on net. Manufacturing activity expanded modestly. Residential real estate activity increased moderately in most Districts, and demand for nonresidential real estate gained overall. Lending activity was mixed. Lending standards were largely unchanged, while credit quality improved. Demand for agricultural products was strong during the reporting period, but growing conditions and production in some areas were somewhat weak as a consequence of extreme weather. Demand for natural resource products was stable or up slightly, and extraction increased in anticipation of further demand growth.                  For most occupations and industries, hiring held steady or increased modestly relative to the prior reporting period. Upward price pressures remained subdued, and prices increased slightly during the reporting period. Wage pressures continued to be modest overall.       Consumer Spending and Tourism        Reports indicated that consumer spending rose in most Districts. A few Districts mentioned that back-to-school sales contributed to overall consumer spending growth. Districts reported retail sales generally grew moderately in Boston, Kansas City, and Dallas; sales were mixed in New York; and sales grew more modestly in Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco. Cleveland noted that sales came in below many retailers' expectations, and Richmond indicated that sales revenues weakened. Boston noted that consumer confidence improved, while New York reported that it retreated a bit. According to reports from Boston, some retailers experienced robust demand gains, with ""year-over-year comparable store sales increases between 4 and 5 percent."" Many Districts noted strong demand for home furnishing and home improvement items. However, reports from several Districts indicated that consumers remained cautious in their purchases and highly price-sensitive. For example, Philadelphia observed that consumers engaged in ""price-shopping,"" as ""sales of children's apparel were stronger at outlets than at traditional malls.""              Attractive financing conditions and pent-up demand supported a robust pace of automobile sales in most Districts. New York noted that sales of high-end brands were especially robust. Richmond reported that one dealership had its best sales month ever, and sales at another dealership doubled relative to twelve months earlier. Used vehicle sales were strong in Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco but a bit soft in New York. New car inventories rose or remained high in Cleveland and San Francisco, but dealers were generally satisfied with their inventory positions; by contrast, Minneapolis reported sales were constrained at some dealerships due to a lack of inventory. Reports from dealerships across the nation were optimistic about demand growth for new and used automobiles for the remainder of the year.              Many Districts pointed to solid gains or high levels of travel and tourist activity, with pickups evident in both the business and leisure segments. Travel and tourism activity expanded overall in the Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts. Relative to the same period a year earlier, Richmond and Minneapolis reported that the number of camping permits and visitors at state and national parks in their Districts increased substantially. New York reported that business at Broadway theaters picked up since the previous reporting period, but Boston highlighted low attendance at some museums. New York and Kansas City both reported that some hotels experienced slightly lower occupancy rates, which may be a result of cutbacks in government travel. A few Districts indicated that business travel activity had also expanded.       Nonfinancial Services        Demand for nonfinancial services improved modestly overall since the previous Beige Book. Adjusting for seasonal fluctuations, providers of various professional and business services such as accounting, consulting, information, transportation, and legal services generally expanded their activities according to reports from Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas. Providers of staffing services in the Boston and New York Districts reported improved business conditions. Several Districts noted increased demand at restaurants, although San Francisco was an exception, with reports from parts of the District indicating that demand had eased. Health-care organizations in the Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts reported soft demand for various health-care services. Boston noted that sales of technology services to businesses and consumers were a bit weaker than expected, and reports from St. Louis indicated that some information technology firms may downsize their workforces. Cleveland indicated that ground cargo volumes were strong; Dallas reported an increase in railroad volumes but a decline in small parcel volumes; and Atlanta observed a decrease in overall trucking volumes. Both Cleveland and Atlanta noted a short supply of truck drivers as a consequence of new hours-of-service regulations. Air freight tonnage ran slightly above year-ago levels for the Atlanta District but was unchanged over the past six weeks for Dallas.       Manufacturing        Manufacturing activity expanded modestly during the reporting period. Kansas City noted a slight contraction in the previous reporting period but indicated that manufacturing activity had expanded moderately in recent weeks. Cleveland and Minneapolis also reported a moderate expansion, although Minneapolis specified that the pace of growth was uneven across District states. Atlanta noted a decrease in the pace of growth as indicated by modest decreases in new orders and production. Several Districts, including Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco, expressed that demand for inputs related to autos, housing, and infrastructure were strong. Chicago highlighted the auto industry as a main source of strength for that District's overall manufacturing sector, and contacts there expect demand for heavy and medium trucks to ratchet up further and to support growth in overall manufacturing for the remainder of the year. By contrast, Cleveland was the only District to report that auto production activity declined, although reports specified that it was a normal seasonal pattern and sales were up relative to twelve months earlier. In the Richmond District, a lumber company purchased new equipment to expand its production; and in Chicago, demand for construction equipment and materials continued to strengthen. Philadelphia reported some increased demand related to ongoing repairs of infrastructure damaged during Superstorm Sandy last year. Reports from San Francisco indicated that shipments of steel products used in nonresidential construction continued to increase, and reports from Chicago indicated that steel output grew at a moderate pace. Boston and San Francisco noted increased demand for semiconductors. High-tech manufacturing firms in the Dallas District noted that demand was stable, and, while Kansas City District firms reported that sales dipped, contacts there expect sales to bounce back in the next three months. In general, contacts in most Districts expressed optimism about a near-term pickup in overall manufacturing activity. Production in the defense industry was mixed across Districts. Contacts in the Boston District reported minimal direct effects of the federal sequestration, although they were concerned about the prospect of larger effects in the fourth quarter. On the other hand, defense firms in the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts reported that the effects of the sequestration have already been passed through to actual reductions in production.       Real Estate and Construction        Activity in residential real estate markets increased moderately. The pace of sales of existing single-family homes continued to increase moderately in most Districts. Sales activity in New York City's co-op and condominium market was described as unusually strong in July and August, and the Cleveland District reported that year-to-date sales of existing single-family homes were up substantially relative to the same period last year. Reports from several Districts suggested that rising home prices and mortgage interest rates may have spurred a pickup in recent market activity, as many ""fence sitters"" were prompted to commit to purchases. Sales of new single-family homes stabilized during the past few months in the Cleveland District after accelerating earlier in the year. New home sales declined slightly in parts of the Philadelphia and Richmond Districts in July. Philadelphia conveyed that some borrowers apparently preferred to lock in a mortgage rate for an existing home rather than wait for a new home to be completed and chance higher mortgage rates. Home prices climbed in most Districts. Richmond and Boston reported that houses in some areas were staying on the market fewer days and increasingly receiving multiple offers. New York noted that bidding wars were common in the Buffalo area. Many Districts reported that limited inventories of desirable properties contributed to upward price pressures. Single-family home construction was strong in the Minneapolis and Dallas Districts, and Chicago reported that a number of builders are planning new developments to begin later this year. However, several Districts noted constraints on the construction of single-family homes. San Francisco pointed to shortages of construction workers. In the Kansas City District, some building materials, such as drywall and roofing shingles, were in short supply.              Demand for nonresidential real estate increased. Office vacancy rates and other indicators in markets for office space improved modestly in the major metropolitan markets in the New York, Richmond, and St. Louis and Districts. Rents for Class B office space in Manhattan have risen more than 10 percent over the past twelve months. Demand for commercial real estate showed strong growth in the Dallas District and moderate growth in the Minneapolis District. Both Districts reported new plans for construction of industrial space. Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported modest growth in demand for commercial real estate. Philadelphia highlighted a shift in recent leasing activity toward larger commercial spaces. The Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts all reported increases in construction of multifamily residential properties.       Banking and Finance        Lending activity weakened a bit, and several Districts reported less-favorable conditions than in the preceding reporting period. Most Districts indicated no better than modest growth. Loan growth in the Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts was slower than in the previous reporting period. Kansas City reported a decline in lending, reversing slight growth earlier in the summer. Several Districts characterized business lending as largely flat. Chicago reported that recent interest rate increases likely were depressing commercial investment. However, Kansas City noted that expectations for better economic conditions and stronger profit growth had offset any effects of rate increases on business loan demand. Demand for mortgage refinance loans declined in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Richmond Districts. By contrast, purchase mortgage lending continued to grow moderately in most Districts, although San Francisco noted that applications have dropped a bit in some areas of that District. In the Atlanta District, increases in home values generated a surge in second mortgages, and Philadelphia and Cleveland reported modest increases in demand for home equity lines of credit.              Lending standards were largely unchanged, while credit quality improved. Reports indicated little change in standards across all lending categories. However, a few Districts commented that stiff competition for high-quality commercial borrowers was eroding loan volumes at banks that maintained prudent interest rates and terms. New York reported widespread declines in delinquency rates, especially for consumer loans and home mortgages, while Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and Kansas City all reported general improvement in loan quality.       Agriculture and Natural Resources        Demand for agricultural products expanded during the reporting period, although production activity was limited by extreme weather in some areas. Droughts or dry weather in the Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts constrained farming activity, but some growing areas within the Chicago and Dallas Districts were relieved by much-needed rainfall. By contrast, extremely wet conditions led to delayed planting and reduced yields for some crops in the Richmond and Atlanta Districts. Kansas City noted that wheat production was below average and corn crops were threatened by disease, and Atlanta and Dallas indicated that the cotton crop was smaller than anticipated. Chicago noted that, despite the dry weather, corn and soybean crops were in better condition than they were during the drought last year. Meanwhile, the St. Louis District anticipates robust production activity, with corn crop yields expected to increase substantially over last year. San Francisco noted that demand was generally strong for most crop and livestock products, and Atlanta found that poultry farming and fruit production were robust.              For producers of natural resource products, demand was mostly steady, while production and extraction activity rose. San Francisco reported a modest decline in demand for some oil products, and Dallas reported stable drilling activity at a high level. Contacts in San Francisco and Dallas expect near- to medium-term oil-related sales and production activity to pick up; contacts in Dallas and Atlanta expect drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico to increase as demand continued to grow. Richmond and Kansas City reported that the number of natural gas rigs increased, but coal production in the Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts was below year-ago levels. Minneapolis reported upgrades to a nuclear power plant and development of oil sands production facilities, and Cleveland noted that unconventional drilling activity increased. Mining activity was flat in the Minneapolis and Richmond Districts.       Employment, Wages, and Prices        For most industries and occupations, hiring held steady or increased somewhat in most Districts. Hiring in manufacturing rose modestly. St. Louis reported increases in employment at a variety of manufacturing firms connected to the auto industry or the home construction industry. Boston, Richmond, and Minneapolis reported shortages of some types of skilled manufacturing workers. Hiring increased for selected services occupations. Increases in demand for information technology workers were widespread. Hiring increased for workers in accounting and health services occupations in several Districts. Retail employment gains were limited. Atlanta reported slight employment increases in Georgia and Florida, and Dallas reported gains in oil and gas producing areas. Cleveland noted that retail employment increases were limited to new stores. Boston and Richmond reported that temporary workers are increasingly being offered permanent employment. A health-care staffing firm in the Boston District reported a 30 percent increase in permanent placements this year. Similarly, a staffing firm in the Dallas District reported ""near-record"" levels of direct hiring by health-care and engineering clients.              Wage pressures remained modest overall. The Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported that wage pressures were largely subdued. Cleveland and Dallas highlighted that, overall, wage pressures at homebuilding and other construction-related firms were contained. New York reported that some firms have become increasingly willing to negotiate salaries, although pay rates have not escalated significantly. Reports from a few Districts highlighted significant labor supply constraints and, in some cases, large compensation increases for workers with specialized skills in selected sectors, including the construction and high-technology sectors in Atlanta and Kansas City and the engineering sector in Dallas. Kansas City also reported that some firms in the retail, leisure, and hospitality industries were beginning to raise wages to attract salespeople, housekeepers, maintenance staff, and clerical staff. Increases in the costs of employee health benefits continued to put upward pressure on overall compensation costs, although Minneapolis indicated that growth in the price of health-care has slowed.              Upward price pressures were subdued, and price increases were limited during the reporting period. Reports from many Districts indicated modest growth, no change, or slight decreases in overall commodity and input prices. In a few Districts, prices of some construction inputs in short supply increased, including lumber, drywall, concrete, and roofing shingles. However, Cleveland noted that the rate of increase for construction input prices slowed, and lumber prices in the Chicago District declined. Dallas reported that law firms had reduced their billing rates slightly. Atlanta and Chicago reported that firms have limited pricing power in general. Similarly, food costs continued to increase in the Kansas City District, but most restaurant owners did not increase menu prices. However, Richmond reported that several construction-related businesses said that they were able to pass along rising input prices.",2013-09-04
93,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and based on information collected on or before October 7, 2013. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.          Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that national economic activity continued to expand at a modest to moderate pace during the reporting period of September through early October. Eight Districts reported similar growth rates in economic activity as during the previous reporting period, while growth slowed some in the Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts. Contacts across Districts generally remained cautiously optimistic in their outlook for future economic activity, although many also noted an increase in uncertainty due largely to the federal government shutdown and debt ceiling debate.              Consumer spending continued to increase and activity in the travel and tourism sector expanded in most Districts. Business spending and payrolls grew in many Districts. Demand for nonfinancial services rose, and manufacturing activity also expanded modestly. Residential construction continued to increase at a moderate pace. By comparison, nonresidential construction again expanded at a slower rate. Residential and commercial real estate activity varied across Districts, but largely continued to improve. Financial conditions were little changed on balance, with lending activity remaining modest in most Districts. There were mixed reports on agriculture, with excess precipitation and drought both impacting the sector. Energy and mining activity expanded or maintained high levels, with the exception of the coal industry in the eastern half of the nation. Price and wage pressures were again limited.       Consumer Spending and Tourism        Consumer spending grew modestly in most Districts. Auto sales continued to be strong, particularly in the New York District where they were said to be increasingly robust. In contrast, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas indicated slower growth in auto sales in September. Growth in retail sales was steady in most of the Districts, but picked up some in Cleveland and Richmond and slowed in Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas. Contacts in Chicago and Atlanta noted that back-to-school spending was lower than a year ago. However, retailers generally remained optimistic about the holiday shopping season, with contacts in Philadelphia and Chicago expecting this year's holiday sales to be about equal to last year's despite the traditional holiday period being six days shorter this year. In addition, Dallas noted strength in retail imports in advance of the holiday season, with growth stronger than a year ago.              Activity in the travel and tourism sector also expanded in most areas, with the reports from the Atlanta, Boston, and New York Districts being particularly upbeat. Dallas indicated that airline passenger demand slowed seasonally, but was slightly stronger than year-ago levels. Tourism contacts in the Boston District were concerned about the potential impact of a protracted federal government shutdown; and Richmond noted that the shutdown had led to the closing of some tourist attractions, although hotel contacts indicated that these closures did not result in guest cancellations. In addition, Kansas City noted lower tourism activity due in part to the severe effects of recent flooding in Colorado.       Business Spending and Hiring        Business spending grew modestly in most Districts. Overall, inventory investment proceeded at a moderate rate. Retail inventories were said to be in-line with sales in the Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas Districts. Philadelphia and Cleveland reported that inventories were on the low side at auto dealers, and Chicago noted the same was true at steel service centers. Philadelphia reported an increase in manufacturers' demand for equipment, while manufacturers in Cleveland and Chicago indicated that current capital outlays were primarily for productivity enhancing investments. Cleveland noted that low natural gas prices and regulatory uncertainty were slowing the build-out of shale-gas transport and processing infrastructure. In contrast, additional infrastructure projects to support natural resource extraction were mentioned in the Richmond, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts. Philadelphia and Chicago reported an increase in spending on information technology. Looking ahead, several Districts noted an improvement in capital spending plans. Manufacturers in Philadelphia and St. Louis, high-tech service firms in Kansas City, and retailers in the Cleveland and St. Louis Districts expected to increase capital spending in the months ahead. Technology contacts in San Francisco relayed expectations for a near-term pick-up in spending on both hardware and software products. In addition, Philadelphia and Minneapolis reported slight increases in activity at architecture firms.              Employment growth remained modest in September. Several Districts reported that contacts were cautious to expand payrolls, citing uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and fiscal policy more generally. Cleveland and Dallas noted that retail hiring was primarily limited to staffing of new stores in their Districts, while contacts in Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago reported that hiring for the holiday season would be about the same as last year. In manufacturing, Boston indicated that hiring primarily was for replacement or to fill key needs, New York noted slower job growth, and Chicago reported that manufacturers were cutting back on overtime. Dallas cited scattered reports of hiring in high-tech, fabricated metals, and food manufacturing. Furthermore, demand for skilled labor remained high in many Districts. Examples included technology, healthcare, and engineering occupations in Richmond, economic and health consulting in Boston, legal and compliance positions in the financial services industry in New York, and accountants and financial analysts in the Dallas District.       Nonfinancial Services        Demand for nonfinancial services increased modestly from the prior reporting period. Boston reported robust growth in consulting, but noted that activity at a government consulting firm remained weaker due to the effects of sequestration. The Minneapolis District reported increased activity in professional business services, whereas demand was more mixed in the Dallas District with strength in accounting services and a modest decrease in legal services. Demand for staffing services increased in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Minneapolis Districts, with New York citing strong demand for information technology occupations and Cleveland highlighting healthcare and manufacturing. In contrast, staffing service activity was down slightly in the Chicago and Dallas Districts. Demand for technology services increased in the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts, but San Francisco indicated that overall demand for nonfinancial services was mixed with healthcare services somewhat weak. Demand for transportation services increased on balance. Port activity remained robust in the Richmond and Atlanta Districts, reflecting exports of grain, auto parts, and forest products and imports of energy products and steel. Atlanta, Kansas City and Dallas cited a modest rise in demand for transportation services. Cleveland reported that the rate of growth in shipping freight volume had slowed recently, and demand for trucking services softened slightly in the Richmond District.       Manufacturing        Overall, manufacturing activity expanded modestly in September, but with some notable exceptions among the Districts. Cleveland, St. Louis, and Minneapolis experienced faster growth, while New York, Richmond, and Chicago saw growth weaken. The automotive and aerospace industries continued to be a source of strength in a number of Districts. Demand for fabricated metals was mixed in the Chicago and Richmond Districts, but stronger in the Dallas District. Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco reported steady increases in the demand for steel; Cleveland, Chicago, and Atlanta indicated that much of the higher demand was being met by imports. Demand for construction materials remained strong for Philadelphia, increased for Cleveland and San Francisco, was flat for Dallas, and was slightly lower for the Chicago District. Cleveland and Dallas reported strong demand for manufactured inputs to energy production, and demand for heavy equipment improved slightly in the Richmond and Chicago Districts. High-tech manufacturing activity edged up in a number of Districts, with Boston and Dallas reporting slightly higher demand for semiconductors, and biotech manufacturing increasing in San Francisco. While there was little immediate disruption from the federal government shutdown, contacts were worried about the potential impact if the closing became prolonged.       Construction and Real Estate        Construction and real estate activity continued to improve in September. Residential construction increased moderately on balance, growing at a stronger pace in the Minneapolis and Dallas Districts but only slightly in Richmond and Philadelphia. Multifamily construction remained stronger than single-family construction in a number of Districts. Residential real estate activity continued to improve at a moderate pace in most Districts, as home sales and prices continued to rise and inventories remained low. Home sales in the New York and Dallas Districts were strong, with the exception of the Jersey Shore, which is still recovering from Hurricane Sandy. The Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts experienced a more modest improvement in home sales. A number of Districts reported concerns from homebuilders and realtors over rising mortgage rates. However, contacts in the Dallas District indicated that rising interest rates were not hurting affordability and contacts in the Boston District suggested some boost to activity by homebuyers entering the market in anticipation of future increases in rates. Nonresidential construction activity remained modest, but varied by market and District. Growth was strong in the Minneapolis District, but up only slightly in Richmond, Atlanta, and Philadelphia. The Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts reported increased activity for industrial building, Cleveland noted strong demand from the healthcare sector, and redevelopment of vacant retail space picked up in Boston. Leasing activity continued to improve modestly in most Districts, but was particularly strong in the Dallas District. A number of Districts reported that vacancy rates continued to fall, rents rose, and the outlook for commercial real estate was generally positive.       Banking and Finance        Financial conditions were little changed on balance from the prior reporting period. Overall loan growth remained modest in most Districts. Consumer loan demand weakened slightly. Reports on mortgage lending were mixed. Several Districts noted a decrease in mortgage lending, citing higher mortgage rates and reduced refinancing activity. However, mortgage originations continued to rise in Philadelphia, Richmond, and Dallas, and rising home prices led to an increase in home equity lending in Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco. Chicago, Cleveland, and Atlanta noted an increase in auto lending, while credit card volumes decreased slightly in Philadelphia. Business loan demand edged higher, with several Districts noting a pick-up in both commercial and industrial and commercial real estate lending. The Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas Districts reported intense competition on pricing and terms for commercial and industrial loans. In addition, contacts in Philadelphia and Chicago expressed concern about an easing of credit standards on these loans. Overall, however, lending standards were largely unchanged and credit quality continued to improve moderately.       Agriculture and Natural Resources        Heavy rains hurt agriculture in the Richmond, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts, even resulting in declarations of some natural disaster areas. At the other extreme, some portions of the Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts experienced drought conditions, although they eased in some areas over the reporting period. Harvests were reported as behind their normal pace. Nonetheless, crop yields were higher than expected in the Chicago District and about average in the Kansas City District. Strong fruit output was noted in the Richmond, Chicago, and Minneapolis Districts. Cotton output was mixed across the South. Prices fell for corn, soybeans, wheat, hay, cotton, hogs, broilers, turkeys, and eggs, but rose for rice, citrus, grapes, milk, cattle, and dry beans. Livestock producers benefited from lower feed costs, as well as higher beef exports according to the Dallas District. San Francisco reported demand remained strong for most crop and livestock products.              Natural resource extraction increased in September. Oil and natural gas activity remained at high levels in the Cleveland and Dallas Districts, was solid in the Kansas City District, and expanded in the Richmond and Minneapolis Districts. Drilling rig counts were stable in the Richmond and Kansas City Districts, although the latter reported a shift in rigs from oil drilling toward natural gas. This shift was driven in part by expectations of higher natural gas prices and lower oil prices in the future. Atlanta and Dallas noted steady demand for energy. San Francisco indicated that demand for oil products edged up, resulting in increased refinery activity. Refinery expansions continued in the Atlanta District, although the cost of transporting inputs to Gulf Coast refineries rose. Mining activity picked up in the Minneapolis District. Coal production in the Cleveland and Richmond Districts slowed, but output was higher in St. Louis and Kansas City.       Prices and Wages        Price pressures remained limited in September. Most Districts reported only slight increases in commodity prices and limited ability to pass through these increases to their customers. Metal prices fell slightly in the Chicago District, but held steady in Minneapolis and were up slightly in Dallas. The Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported upward pressure on prices for building materials such as asphalt, brick, lumber, and concrete, with Kansas City indicating that concrete was in short supply in the Colorado areas affected by flooding. Energy prices in most Districts were steady to slightly lower than during the prior reporting period. In general, prices for final goods were little changed, except for a faster increase in retail prices in the Richmond District and higher food prices in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts. Wage pressures remained modest overall, though the Minneapolis and Richmond Districts reported moderate wage increases. Most Districts reported continued upward wage pressure for skilled workers, particularly those in consulting, accounting, information technology, engineering, and skilled manufacturing and construction trades.",2013-10-16
94,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and based on information collected on or before November 22, 2013. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.                              Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that the economy continued to expand at a modest to moderate pace from early October through mid-November. Activity in the New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts grew at a moderate pace, while Philadelphia, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco cited modest growth. Boston reported that economic activity continued to expand.              Manufacturing activity continued to expand in most Districts, with gains noted in the motor-vehicle and high-technology industries. Manufacturers in many Districts expressed optimism about near-term growth prospects. Demand for professional business services experienced stable to moderate growth, especially in computer technologies. Freight volume showed signs of strengthening. Reports on retail spending were positive. Looking forward to the holiday shopping season, retailers reported being hopeful, but cautious. Sales of new motor vehicles were reported as moderate to strong across much of the United States. Tourism increased in most reporting Districts, although the federal government shutdown had a negative impact in some areas. Residential real estate activity improved across many Districts, with multifamily construction experiencing moderate to strong growth. Some slowing in single-family home sales was attributed to seasonal factors. Activity in nonresidential real estate was stable or improved slightly across many Districts. Agricultural conditions were generally favorable. Mining activity was mixed, while natural gas production increased. Banking conditions were largely stable, with some improvement seen in loan demand. Several Districts reported an easing of lending standards.              Hiring showed a modest increase or was unchanged across Districts. Difficulty with finding qualified workers, especially for high-skilled positions, was frequently reported. Upward pressure on wages and overall price inflation were contained. Contacts in many Districts voiced concern about future cost increases attributable to the Affordable Care Act and other types of federal regulation.   Manufacturing        Manufacturing activity expanded at a modest to moderate pace in most Districts during the reporting period. Firms in Philadelphia and Cleveland are beginning to take a more conservative stance toward capital spending, while capital outlays remain solid in Boston and Kansas City. Companies across a number of sectors in Philadelphia noted a reduction in activity due to the federal government shutdown, while defense contractors in Boston reported that sequestration has not yet affected them significantly. Chicago highlighted the motor-vehicle industry as a main source of strength due to a large number of new vehicle launches and increasing demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks. Cleveland and St. Louis also reported increased motor-vehicle production. Steel producers in Dallas and San Francisco indicated that demand was steady, while producers in Cleveland and Chicago experienced a slight drop-off in production, even though they are beginning to see a reduction in the quantity of steel imports. San Francisco noted an increase in demand for semiconductors driven by demand for mobile-technology products, while the aerospace industry in the Pacific Northwest reported a large backlog of orders for commercial aircraft. High-tech manufacturing firms in the Dallas District said that demand was flat to modestly weaker; however, respondents expect a gradual increase in demand over the next three to six months. In Kansas City, sales among high-tech firms moderated but were positive overall; several firms cited a reduction in government contracts due to sequestration as the main cause for the slowing. Wood-product manufacturers in Minneapolis and San Francisco saw an improvement in business activity. Contacts in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts expressed varying degrees of optimism about near-term business activity. Nonetheless, some contacts in Cleveland and Chicago observed that heightened levels of uncertainty, driven in part by fiscal issues, could dampen demand.       Nonfinancial Services        Demand for nonfinancial services was stable or grew at a moderate pace across most reporting Districts. Boston and San Francisco noted that demand for software and information technology (IT) services was strong. IT contacts in Boston have grown more optimistic and are expecting continued growth into 2014. The Richmond District noted growth in server farms. Dallas reported that multiple service sectors, including accounting, legal, and intellectual property, were experiencing stable to improving demand. Most of the Districts that commented on the partial shutdown of the federal government said that its impact on service providers was modest or temporary. The Dallas District reported that airline activity is mixed but has increased since the cessation of the shutdown; however, seasonal factors were also noted. Concerns linger in Dallas about the upcoming second round of sequestration cuts.              Transportation and freight services, especially those related to railroads, ports, and trucking, strengthened across Districts. Port activity in Richmond was robust, with exports of containerized grain and imports of housing-related products continuing to grow. Imports and exports of autos and auto parts remained strong. Year-to-date shipping volumes were higher in Cleveland when compared to the same time period in 2012. Freight haulers were hiring for both replacement and capacity expansion. Retail and e-commerce activity in Dallas continued to drive growth in the transportation sector. Logistics contacts in Atlanta were forecasting record volumes during the holiday season due to online sales.       Consumer Spending and Tourism        Consumer spending increased in almost all Districts at a modest to moderate pace. A Boston retailer noted that sales performance during the 2013 holiday season will be a better test of what seems to be an improving trend. Philadelphia retailers reported hopeful, but very uncertain expectations for the holiday season, while retailer expectations in the Atlanta District for the holiday season are only mildly optimistic. Stores in Minneapolis and Kansas City are cautiously optimistic about the buying mood of holiday shoppers. Demand for home furnishings was strongest in Boston, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City. Apparel sales were strong in the Boston, Cleveland, and Kansas City Districts. Retailers in Boston, New York, Cleveland, and Dallas indicated that their store inventories are at desired levels.              Sales of new motor vehicles continued at a moderate to strong pace across most Districts, although Dallas reported a slight decline, which was attributed to a lack of consumer confidence and continued uncertainty. Motor-vehicle purchases in Kansas City were flat. Dealers in Cleveland and St. Louis saw a pick up in purchases of SUVs and cross-over vehicles. Chicago indicated that lower gasoline prices were motivating buyers to shift away from more fuel-efficient vehicles. Used-car sales were mixed, with Cleveland and St. Louis reporting an increase, while purchases in the New York District were soft.              Reports on tourism varied. Due to the federal government shutdown, tourist destinations in the Boston, Richmond, and Minneapolis Districts experienced lower traffic. In Philadelphia, some super-storm Sandy-affected areas of the New Jersey shore continued to experience lighter traffic than normal. Boston reported that tourism activity at hotels and restaurants exceeded usual expectations due to additional business brought in by the World Series. New York reported strong tourism activity attributed in part to Broadway performance openings. Cold-weather expectations have boosted ski bookings in Richmond. Contacts there noted that the strength in bookings has allowed them to raise rates for the first time in several years. Atlanta and Minneapolis reported that tourism expanded. In the San Francisco District, Hawaii maintained its solid pace of growth. In contrast, Las Vegas tourism remained relatively weak, and contacts pointed to a moderate year-over-year decline in automobile traffic in the region.       Real Estate and Construction        Residential real estate activity improved in Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco, while remaining steady or softening in other Districts. Some slowing in single-family home sales was attributed to seasonal factors. Nonetheless, sales remain largely above year-ago levels. Increasing demand, low to declining levels of inventory, and slowly rising new-home construction were cited by almost all Districts as reasons for a continued rise in home prices, but at a slower pace than was observed earlier in 2013. Historically low inventories of unsold homes were reported in Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas. Chicago noted that the inventory of homes for sale is at a record low. In the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, builders continued to face a scarcity of high-skilled trade workers. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and Chicago indicated that multifamily construction continued to experience moderate to strong growth, with strength concentrated in the apartment segment. Vacancy rates declined across most Districts.              Commercial real estate activity remained stable or improved slightly across many Districts. Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis all saw gains in industrial construction, while Boston, Chicago, and St. Louis cited a rise in hotel construction. The technology sector drove demand for commercial real estate in the San Francisco District, and Cleveland saw gains in affordable housing and shale-gas-related activity. The outlook of market participants is for continued improvement in the Philadelphia, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts, while contacts were cautiously optimistic in Boston and Cleveland.       Banking and Finance        On balance, banking conditions remained stable in a majority of reporting Districts. Loan volume showed a modest increase in Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco, while Boston and Atlanta reported a moderate rise. Dallas noted that loan demand softened across most lines of business during the reporting period. An increase in business-credit activity was seen in a number of Districts. Commercial real estate lending increased in New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Demand for commercial and industrial (C&I) loans rose in the New York, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts, but weakened in St. Louis. C&I lending was unchanged in Chicago. In the Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts, some bankers eased lending standards in response to aggressive competition for quality loans. Lending standards remained unchanged across loan categories in New York, Cleveland, St Louis, and Kansas City. Consumer borrowing weakened in a few Districts, including New York, Richmond, and St. Louis. In Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas, demand for consumer loans was little changed, while it increased in Chicago. Lower residential mortgage activity was reported in many Districts. Bankers in Cleveland, Richmond, and Atlanta attributed the decline in part to higher interest rates than earlier in the year. New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas reported declines in refinancing activity as well. Several Districts reported increased credit quality, as delinquencies have continued to decline and fewer problem loans have been reported.       Agriculture and Natural Resources        Strong crop yields were reported, while in general, agricultural commodity prices fell and drought conditions stabilized or improved. Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City reported strong crop yields for fall harvests. Contacts in the Kansas City District noted decreases in farm incomes and increases in the demand for farm operating loans, as prices softened in response to rising yields. The Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts indicated strong demand and increased profitability in livestock due to lower feed costs. Atlanta contacts reported making investments in various types of agricultural equipment as a means to further improve production and contain costs. Prices paid to farmers for wheat, corn, and soybeans fell in Atlanta, Chicago, and Minneapolis. However, in Chicago, higher exports cushioned the decline. The Kansas City District indicated rising farmland values, although the rate of increase slowed.              Reports indicated a continued expansion in energy demand and production. Coal mining activity was mixed across the Cleveland and Richmond Districts and higher in St. Louis. In Cleveland and Richmond, the completion of pipeline connections and gas-processing plants contributed to an increase in natural gas drilling and extraction, while gas production rose in the Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. San Francisco noted an increase in wind and solar energy production facilities. In Minneapolis, regulatory approval has been obtained for a large wind farm in North Dakota. The Minneapolis District also reported solid mining activity in precious metals and an increase in iron ore production, while oil and gas exploration was flat or fell slightly.       Employment, Wages, and Prices        Hiring showed a modest increase in the Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts, while hiring in the remaining Districts was largely unchanged. Industries that reported moderate employment growth included construction, software and IT services, manufacturing, and healthcare. Temporary holiday hiring is in progress. Cleveland reported that year-over-year growth in retail holiday hiring is expected to be flat; however, some employers noted that they are having difficulty finding seasonal workers. In Chicago, part-time seasonal hiring is slightly lower than normal as a result of retailers' choosing to increase current employees' hours instead of hiring new workers. Some employers in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts reported having difficulty finding qualified workers for certain permanent, high-skilled positions. In Philadelphia, a builder reported that contractors are reluctant to hire workers who require training. Instead, contractors are aggressively hiring skilled labor from each other. On net, staffing services across Districts remain more optimistic than they were three months ago, expecting steady growth through the end of the year and into 2014.              Overall wage pressures remain contained across most Districts, with a modest increase reported in Boston, New York, and Dallas. Contacts in the Cleveland, Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts noted some upward pressure on wages for skilled jobs, such as craft labor, engineering, IT, and accounting. Contacts in California's restaurant industry projected higher labor costs, as the state's minimum wage increases take hold over the next few years. Builders in the Philadelphia and Cleveland Districts cited a scarcity of high-skilled trade workers. As a result, there is upward pressure on wages, and subcontractors are demanding and getting higher rates.              Price inflation is contained, with phrases such as ""minimal,"" ""no change,"" and ""stable"" being common across most Districts. However, in New York, service-sector firms reported that price pressure was moderate and that a sizable number of firms were planning at least some price increases in the coming months. The Cleveland, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts also commented that prices for residential construction materials, such as lumber and drywall, continued to rise, but the Cleveland District noted that the rate of increase has recently slowed. Contacts across many Districts continue to voice concerns about future cost increases attributable to the Affordable Care Act and other types of federal regulation.",2013-12-04
95,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and based on information collected on or before January 6, 2014. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.           Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest economic activity continued to expand across most regions and sectors from late November through the end of the year. Nine Districts indicated the local economy was expanding at a moderate pace; among these, the Atlanta and Chicago Districts saw conditions improve compared with the previous reporting period. Boston and Philadelphia cited modest growth, while Kansas City reported the economy held steady in December. The economic outlook is positive in most Districts, with some reports citing expectations of ""more of the same"" and some expecting a pickup in growth.                  Three-quarters of the Districts indicated that retail activity had increased since the last Beige Book report. The exceptions were St. Louis and Kansas City, where retail results were mixed, and the Richmond District, which cited a softening of retail sales. Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco noted strong auto sales. Districts mentioning nonfinancial services noted increased activity, except for Richmond, which cited ""little change"" in demand for non-retail services. All Districts reported year-over-year increases in manufacturing activity, although Kansas City noted slower growth in December.              Real estate markets generally continued to improve, according to District reports. Although a few Districts indicated home sales or residential construction in some areas had slowed or declined in recent months, most cited increased residential sales activity and construction as well as rising home prices. Reports on commercial real estate were also positive, with commercial construction generally increasing. Two-thirds of the Districts reported increases in commercial sales and leasing activity. According to District reports that mention banking, loan volumes have not changed substantially since the last reporting period. The eight Districts reporting on energy indicated that activity continued increasing; Cleveland and Atlanta cited robust growth in the energy sector. Reports on agriculture were also mostly positive.              Almost half the Districts reported that prices were stable; most other Districts noted small increases in prices. Upward movements in wages were cited by 8 of the 12 Districts; the increases were described as small to moderate. Two-thirds of Districts noted increases in hiring; the Richmond District cited ""numerous reports of strong labor demand.""       Consumer Spending and Tourism        Most Districts reported that retail spending was up, with activity described as modestly to moderately higher and holiday sales on plan or up a bit compared with 2012. However, Richmond noted a general slowdown in retail spending in recent weeks and the Kansas City District cited lower than expected holiday sales, which retailers there attributed to a shorter selling season and harsh weather conditions. Atlanta and San Francisco both noted that in-store sales were softer than online sales. Apparel sales were reportedly strong in Boston and Richmond, while Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago indicated that cold-weather gear and winter items were selling well. Home furnishings, home improvement items, and/or furniture sold particularly well in the Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, and San Francisco Districts. Demand for electronics was quite strong in the Cleveland and Minneapolis Districts, but San Francisco reported that electronics sales were weaker than in recent years. Kansas City and Dallas reported lagging sales for higher-priced big ticket items.              New York, Philadelphia, and Kansas City reported that automobile sales declined a bit in December; dealer contacts in the New York and Kansas City Districts reported higher inventory levels. Contacts in the Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts said that automobile sales remain strong. Auto sales were mixed across areas within the Dallas District. Chicago and Minneapolis reported that light-vehicle sales increased; Cleveland observed that consumers continue to shift from smaller, more fuel-efficient cars to SUVs, crossovers, and light trucks. The 2014 outlook for vehicle sales is strong in the Philadelphia, Richmond, Cleveland, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts.              Reports on leisure and tourism spending were mixed across and within Districts. The Richmond District reported flat to slower bookings in recent weeks, except for resorts specializing in winter activities. San Francisco indicated that travel and tourism were down in Hawaii and remained somewhat weak in Las Vegas. Minneapolis reported that winter tourism activity was off to a solid start on account of snowy weather. The Kansas City District indicated that tourism activity increased slightly since the last survey and increased modestly year-over-year. Hospitality contacts in the Atlanta District reported strong advance bookings and increases in occupancy rates, room rates, and revenue per room during the 2013 holiday season compared with year-earlier levels.       Nonfinancial Services        Districts mentioning consumer and business services reported that demand for nonfinancial services increased moderately since the previous Beige Book report. The Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts cited increased growth in information technology services; in the San Francisco District, this growth reflected strong demand for cloud services. The Boston District generally reported strengthened activity in the consulting and advertising industries with the exception of a firm that provides consulting services mostly to government agencies. Healthcare, internet technology, restaurant, telecommunications, and distribution firms expanded in the St. Louis District. Other reports of growth included legal and real estate services in the Dallas District and professional and business services in the Minneapolis District. By contrast, contacts in the Richmond District generally reported flat nonretail service growth, citing soft demand in the trucking and healthcare sectors. Demand for staffing services increased in the New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas Districts, notably to serve the internet technology and engineering sectors.              Reports on transportation services were generally positive. Port activity remained strong in the Richmond District. Logistics contacts in the Atlanta District reported expansion in the movement of industrial and healthcare-related goods. Rail contacts noted year-over-year increases in intermodal traffic in the Atlanta District and heightened cargo volumes in the Dallas District. Similarly, freight transportation executives in the Cleveland District reported that shipping volume was in line with or exceeded expectations. One contact in the Philadelphia District observed ""booming"" growth for most modes of transportation. In contrast, transportation companies in the Kansas City District reported a slight decrease in business activity in recent weeks, while both intermodal cargo volumes and air cargo volumes fell in the Dallas District. Airline demand in the Dallas District was largely unchanged.              The outlook for 2014 is positive, with most Districts reporting that contacts expected activity in nonfinancial services sectors to continue to increase at a moderate to strong pace.       Manufacturing        Reports from the 12 Districts generally painted a picture of steady growth in manufacturing. All but one District reported both growing sales and an optimistic outlook; only Kansas City reported a decline in manufacturing production and shipments in December, although activity remained above year-earlier levels. A manufacturer in the Dallas District said that for the first time since before the recession, his firm had too many jobs to bid on. Employment was generally described as ""steady"" with few instances of rapid growth but very few reports of staff cuts or plant closings. Contacts in several Districts reported concerns about health care cost inflation. Capital spending was generally up and contacts anticipated further growth.              Three specific areas of strength in manufacturing were mentioned by multiple Districts: commercial aviation, autos, and construction materials. The Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts reported exceptional strength in commercial aviation driven by record backlogs at major aircraft producers. The Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts said that the recovering housing market had led to increased demand for construction materials going all the way from raw materials like lumber to finished products like kitchen cabinets. Similarly, the Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts reported above-average strength in the auto industry. Contacts in the Cleveland District said that most auto suppliers were at or near capacity; one respondent there estimated that 85 percent of auto suppliers should be adding capacity right now but indicated that many are reluctant to do so.              News about semiconductors was mixed, with contacts in the Boston District citing strong demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment and contacts in the San Francisco District reporting gradually increasing sales of chips. Contacts in the Dallas District said that demand for memory chips was rising but demand for logic devices remained soft. The one area of weakness was manufacturers of defense-related products; contacts in the Cleveland District expressed hope that the recently enacted federal budget agreement would provide a boost to defense contractors this year and next.       Real Estate and Construction        Most Districts reported increases in home sales in the closing months of 2013 compared with last year, but the Atlanta, Cleveland, and Kansas City Districts indicated that year-over-year residential sales growth had slowed relative to earlier quarters in 2013. The Boston, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Dallas reports noted that at least some areas within those Districts saw home sales below year-earlier levels. Home selling prices continued their upward trend in the Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, while remaining stable in the Cleveland and Richmond Districts; New York noted mixed changes in sale prices across the District. Residential construction saw slight to moderate increases in most Districts; by contrast, Dallas cited a slight decline, New York reported no change, and Cleveland cited strong growth. Notwithstanding its decrease in overall residential construction, the Dallas District noted elevated construction levels for multi-family units; the Atlanta, Cleveland, and Chicago Districts also cited strong multifamily construction. Reporting Districts indicated that residential real estate contacts remained optimistic looking forward, while voicing concerns about declining inventory and potential changes in the mortgage market. The Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported that contacts expected residential construction to pick up in the near term.              District reports on commercial real estate contained much good news, although performance within some Districts was uneven across locations and property types. Commercial leasing activity increased in the Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts, as well as in New York City and Long Island, and held roughly steady in the Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Industrial leasing activity weakened in the New York District in the fourth quarter but improved in both the Richmond and St. Louis Districts. Office and other commercial vacancy rates were mixed across and within metropolitan areas and across property types. Commercial rents increased at least modestly on average in the Boston, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts and held steady in the New York and Richmond Districts. Commercial real estate investment continued to strengthen across numerous Districts, with brisk sales activity in the Boston, Chicago, and Minneapolis Districts and rising prices in those same Districts as well as in the Richmond and Kansas City Districts. Excepting the New York and Dallas Districts, which gave no information on recent construction, all other Districts reported increases in commercial construction activity in recent weeks. In the Boston and Richmond Districts, construction activity increased in the education and healthcare sectors. A significant number of commercial high-rise structures are being built (or planned) in the San Francisco District. Information concerning the commercial real estate outlook was largely positive where it was reported. Contacts in the Boston, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts were optimistic that commercial real estate fundamentals would continue to improve at least slowly in 2014. The outlook for commercial construction activity was positive in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts.       Banking and Financial Services        Among Districts reporting on banking, none noted substantial changes in loan volume. Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco reported slight to moderate growth. The Cleveland, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts reported no change, whereas New York cited a moderate decline in loan volume. In addition, while no Districts reported major changes in credit standards, Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco cited instances where financial institutions relaxed their underwriting standards. Some contacts attributed this relaxation to increased competition in lending markets. Among reporting Districts, credit quality held steady or increased, with the New York District citing declines in delinquency rates for all lending categories.              Residential real estate loans declined in the New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts, mostly due to slowdowns in refinancing activity rather than in new purchase loan applications; in fact, the latter have slightly increased in some Districts. The St. Louis District reported no change in residential real estate loan volume.              Commercial real estate loans increased in the Cleveland District, remained steady in the New York and Kansas City Districts, and fell in the Philadelphia and St. Louis Districts. Business and industrial loan demand increased in the Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts while remaining stable in Cleveland and Kansas City and declining in the St. Louis District. The Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas Districts reported increases in auto lending. Regarding demand deposits at financial institutions, deposit volumes increased in the Cleveland and Dallas Districts, remained stable in Kansas City, and decreased in the St. Louis District. Contacts in some Districts expressed concern about new banking regulations and their potential negative impact on lending and operating costs.       Agriculture and Natural Resources        Most Districts reporting on agriculture indicated that yields and growing conditions were generally strong and improving in late November and December; by exception, the Atlanta District observed mixed results and Minneapolis cited weaker farm conditions. Corn and soybean prices remained very low across the country, and the Chicago and Kansas City Districts reported that some farmers have been holding onto fall crop inventories rather than sell at current prices. Kansas City and Dallas reported that the winter wheat crop is in good shape due to moisture provided by winter storms, although storms slightly delayed the cotton harvest. The Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts cited increased profitability in cattle production attributed to flat or rising cattle prices coupled with reduced feed costs and better pasture conditions. Builders in the San Francisco District reported that timber supplies were sufficient to meet rising demand.              District reports indicated continued strong energy demand and production. The Atlanta, Kansas City and Dallas Districts cited robust oil drilling activity both inland and offshore, despite rising costs to transport crude oil along the Gulf Coast; meanwhile exploration in the Gulf of Mexico has been bolstered by the completion of pipeline infrastructure projects. Coal production was slightly up in the St. Louis and Kansas City Districts but mixed in the Cleveland and Richmond Districts, as Appalachian producers struggled with low coal prices and regulation. Natural gas production was stable at a high level in the Cleveland District, up slightly in the Richmond and San Francisco Districts, and mixed in the Minneapolis District. Most Minneapolis District iron ore mines continued to operate near capacity; however an environmental impact report on a proposed copper-nickel mine has brought the future of the project into question. A judge's ruling brought a proposed $250 million solar power project in Minnesota closer to development.       Wages and Prices        Most District reports indicated that wage and price pressures were contained and did not present major problems for local contacts. Prices were said to be generally stable in the Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts; they reportedly increased slightly in the Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts. New York and Dallas cited modest price increases; both mentioned that some service-sector firms plan to raise their selling prices in the near term. Most District reports indicated that cost pressures remained stable or increased only slightly. Manufacturers in a number of Districts reported that raw material prices were generally steady, with small increases in the prices of some metals. Kansas City cited an increase in the prices of some raw materials but not in the prices of finished products. Cleveland indicated that both input and finished products prices remained mostly unchanged.              The Cleveland and Atlanta Districts reported steady wages, with Atlanta noting that merit increases remained in the 1 to 3 percent range. The Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts reported slight to modest increases in wages; among these, Richmond noted that average wages declined in the service sector but increased in manufacturing, while Chicago and Kansas City observed that wage pressures were lower compared with the previous reporting period. By contrast, Dallas noted a pickup in reports of pay increases and wage pressures, while Minneapolis indicated that labor markets were showing signs of tightening, and wage increases were moderate.",2014-01-15
96,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and based on information collected before February 24, 2014. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.          Reports from most of the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that economic conditions continued to expand from January to early February. Eight Districts reported improved levels of activity, but in most cases the increases were characterized as modest to moderate. New York and Philadelphia experienced a slight decline in activity, which was mostly attributed to the unusually severe weather experienced in those regions. Growth slowed in Chicago, and Kansas City reported that conditions remained stable during the reporting period. The outlook among most Districts remained optimistic.                  Retail sales growth weakened since the previous report for most Districts, as severe winter weather limited activity. However, Richmond, St. Louis, and Minneapolis reported modest sales growth since the beginning of the year. Weather was also cited as a contributing factor to softer auto sales in many Districts, with the exception of Cleveland, which saw strong gains. Tourism increased in a number of Districts but declined in Philadelphia and was reported to have been mixed in New York and Minneapolis.              The demand for nonfinancial services was mixed compared with the last report; however, both Boston and San Francisco reported strong demand for technology related services. Manufacturing sales and production in several Districts were negatively impacted by severe winter weather; however, modest improvements were noted in Boston, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas.              Residential real estate markets continued to improve in several areas, albeit modestly. Boston and New York gave mixed reports on sales, and Philadelphia, Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Kansas City noted a decrease in sales. Many Districts cited low inventories of housing and continued home price appreciation. Commercial real estate leasing expanded, according to most reports, while reports on construction activity were mixed. Demand for commercial real estate loans was solid in Boston, improved slightly in Dallas, and continued to grow steadily in Chicago and Kansas City.              Of the Districts that reported on agriculture, conditions softened in Kansas City and Dallas as dry soil adversely affected wheat crops. Districts reported that energy production and demand continued to increase as a result of increased demand due to the unusually cold winter.              Employment levels improved gradually for most Districts, and shortages of specialized skilled labor continued to be reported. Price pressures remained subdued, with the exception of upward cost pressures for some energy and construction products. Wage pressures remained stable for most Districts.       Consumer Spending and Tourism        Most Districts reported sales growth had softened from January to early February. New York reported noticeable weakness; however, Richmond, St. Louis, and Minneapolis reported modest growth since the beginning of the year. The extreme winter weather conditions reportedly contributed to the decline in sales in some markets; however, Richmond, Chicago, and Minneapolis reported that weather-related goods contributed to positive sales growth. Reports from furniture retailers in Boston and Minneapolis indicated strong sales. Contacts in Cleveland, Richmond, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco expected retail spending to improve going forward. Vehicle sales varied across Districts. Severe weather conditions resulted in softer vehicle sales as reported by New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas. Cleveland noted a modest increase in auto sales compared with a year ago. New York cited upcoming auto shows as an expected boost for future sales, while Chicago anticipates that sales incentives will increase near-term sales.              Travel and tourism was generally strong across most reporting Districts except for Philadelphia who recorded a slight decrease. San Francisco stated that the level of travel and tourism increased in their region. Recent winter weather conditions benefited many ski resorts in Kansas City, Richmond, and Minneapolis. Atlanta and Boston also indicated that hotels fared well from the weather, but that restaurants, museums, and other attractions were negatively impacted. New York reported mixed activity from January to early February. Hotel occupancy rates in Manhattan and New Jersey increased, buoyed by the Super Bowl, while hotel business was down in western New York State due to the harsh winter storms. Airline contacts from Dallas indicated solid to slightly stronger demand, with some temporary disruptions due to severe winter weather across the nation. The majority of Districts reported a solid start in the first quarter for hotel bookings, occupancy, and revenue with an optimistic outlook for the remainder of the year.       Nonfinancial Services        Reports from Districts mentioning nonfinancial business services indicated that activity has been mixed since the previous report. Both New York and Philadelphia reported that severe winter weather reduced demand for services in their region. Activity in Minnesota and San Francisco's professional business service firms improved since their last report. Boston said that demand for software and information technology was stronger than expected, and demand for cloud computing remained strong according to San Francisco's report. Richmond service providers noted flat revenue in recent weeks, while sales were characterized as stable among Kansas City service providers. The outlook among contacts was mixed, as well. Planned activity in St. Louis was described as negative, while contacts in Minneapolis and Dallas noted optimism. Contacts in Kansas City anticipate activity will pick up, while software and IT professionals in San Francisco are cautiously optimistic and anticipate revenue growth will be positive this quarter.              Transportation activity since the previous report was mixed. Severe weather reportedly disrupted supply chains and delayed shipments in several Districts. In Dallas, railroad cargo volumes fell slightly below year earlier levels, with winter weather conditions across the country largely to blame. Port activity in Atlanta and Richmond reflected increases in auto shipments, while Dallas reported declines in container volumes. Atlanta and Dallas indicated air cargo was down, compared with year earlier levels. Kansas City cited increasing optimism about future transportation activity, while Cleveland noted expectations that demand in 2014 will be the same or only moderately higher than a year ago.       Manufacturing        Manufacturing activity expanded at a moderate pace from January through early February in most Districts. Several Districts reported that severe winter weather had a negative effect on sales and production during this period, including Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas. The weather was cited to have caused utility outages, disrupted supply chains and production schedules, and resulted in a slowing of sales to affected customers. Philadelphia and Richmond reported that shipments and orders declined during the first half of February. Steel producers in Cleveland indicated that they have excess capacity, and San Francisco reported low capacity utilization rates at steel mills. Boston and San Francisco indicated that semiconductor sales had been particularly strong. High-tech contacts in Dallas reported a slight improvement in orders, as demand for memory chips remained strong and demand for logic devices remained weak but stable. San Francisco also cited growth in the commercial aerospace industry due to a backlog in orders for commercial aircraft, while defense-related manufacturers reported sluggish overall conditions and expected sales to trend downward. Auto production was strong in Chicago despite weather-related slowdowns in sales, and Cleveland reported auto production to be higher than a year ago. Most Districts were optimistic about the future and expect manufacturing activity to rise in the coming months.       Real Estate and Construction        Reports on residential housing markets were somewhat mixed. Many Districts continued to report improving conditions but noted that growth had slowed. Most of the Districts indicating otherwise attributed the slowing pace of improvement to unusually severe winter weather conditions. Home sales increased in Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas, while sales were down in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Kansas City. Boston and New York reported that the trend in sales for their Districts was mixed. New home construction increased in Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis, and remained flat in Kansas City, and was down slightly from the previous period in Philadelphia. Most Districts reported low levels of home inventories and indicated that home prices continued to appreciate. The outlook for sales and residential construction was positive in Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, and San Francisco.              Strong multifamily construction was cited in New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, and Dallas, while Boston indicated that its pipeline of multifamily construction was declining. Dallas experienced rent growth above its historical average, while New York reported mixed trends in rent growth. Cleveland noted that it expects healthy growth in rents this year.              Many Districts, including New York, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco, indicated that commercial real estate activity had increased and that conditions continued to improve since the previous report. Philadelphia noted that there was very little activity to report in construction or leasing due to severe winter weather. The outlook for nonresidential construction was fairly optimistic in Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco.       Banking and Financial Services        District reports of loan demand and volume were mixed. Demand for residential mortgages decreased in New York, Richmond, St. Louis, and Kansas City, and softened in Philadelphia and Dallas. Cleveland and Atlanta noted increased demand for new purchase mortgages, while mortgage refinancing declined in New York, Richmond, Atlanta, and Kansas City. Demand for consumer loans grew slightly in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas, and held steady in Kansas City. Decreased demand for consumer loans was noted by Richmond and St. Louis, and among small to medium-sized banks in New York. Boston reported commercial real estate loans were highly competitive and demand was solid. Richmond businesses looked for shorter-term commercial real estate loans in order to benefit from lower interest rates those loans offered. Chicago and Kansas City reported steady growth in commercial real estate loans, and demand for such loans improved marginally in Dallas. Small to medium-sized banks in New York reported no change in commercial real estate loan demand.              New York noted modest declines in delinquency rates. Cleveland reported delinquencies were stable or trended lower, and St. Louis indicated delinquencies for most types of loans decreased. Loan quality in Kansas City improved compared with a year ago and continued to strengthen in Dallas. Bankers in Cleveland and Atlanta voiced concerns about recently enacted regulations and the potential negative impact on lending.       Agriculture and Natural Resources        Agricultural conditions softened since the previous report. Severe winter weather affected several Districts with some crop damage being reported by Richmond and Atlanta, while Chicago noted disruptions in the flow of agricultural products. Both Kansas City and Dallas cited dry conditions adversely affecting wheat crops, while San Francisco reported concerns about water shortages and water costs. Several Districts noted falling feed prices had a positive effect for cattle and hog producers. Kansas City indicated farmland price appreciation moderated from the rapid pace seen in the past few years. Crop prices received in January by farmers fell from a year earlier for corn, wheat, soybeans, hogs, and chickens; prices increased for cotton, rice, oranges, cattle, milk, eggs, and turkeys.              District reports showed continued strength in energy production and demand for oil and gas; much of the increased demand was driven by unusually cold winter weather. Cleveland, Richmond, and St. Louis reported coal production was down, with steam coal plant closures in Richmond. Cleveland, Atlanta, and Dallas described growth in drilling (both inland and offshore) and refining activity. In contrast, Minneapolis indicated that oil and gas exploration decreased slightly from recent months, primarily due to the extremely cold weather. Inventory drawdowns and supply shortages of natural gas and propane were reported in Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas due to increased withdrawals that were exacerbated by the severe weather. Nearly all Districts attributed energy price surges to increased demand during the unusually cold weather; yet, Boston reported that natural gas prices were also driven up by pressure on pipeline capacity in New England. Some firms in the Richmond and Chicago Districts indicated that they elected to delay production and/or reduce usage rather than pay high prices. Dallas indicated that increases in the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil were being bolstered by debottlenecking at Cushing, Oklahoma.       Employment, Wages, and Prices        Since the previous report, the pace of hiring had reportedly softened in Boston, Richmond, and Chicago, with those Districts attributing at least part of the recent slowdown to unusually bad winter weather. Despite a pickup in hiring in some sectors across New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, and St. Louis, notably in manufacturing, overall employment growth for these Districts remained sluggish. In Philadelphia, as outlooks for long-term overall economic growth improved, firms reportedly continued to expand their headcounts cautiously. In contrast, labor markets in the Minneapolis District tightened slightly. The rate at which temporary employees were converted to permanent hires remained strong across Boston, while contacts in Richmond reported this conversion was happening at a slightly faster pace than previously noted. Many Districts continued to note shortages for particular types of specialized, technical skilled labor, such as healthcare professionals and information technology workers. Atlanta and Dallas also noted shortages for freight truck drivers.              Inflation pressures remained largely unchanged across most Districts. Price pressures were described as minimal or roughly steady in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco. There were some mentions of rising raw materials prices passing through to final goods. Boston indicated that higher material costs and rising costs of overseas labor could have an upward influence on apparel prices. Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas noted that unseasonably cold weather had pushed up costs for some energy products. Construction materials prices remained a source of upward cost pressure, according to contacts in Atlanta and Kansas City. Retail contacts in New York and Philadelphia reported deep product discounting; however, reports from Dallas indicated that retail prices were stable.              Most Districts noted that wage pressures were largely steady since the last report; however, a few Districts cited upward wage pressures in some highly skilled jobs in industries such as information technology, transportation, and construction. Reports from Cleveland, Kansas City, and San Francisco indicated that businesses were anticipating wage growth to increase from the recent mild pace as the year progresses. Contacts in Chicago indicated that higher healthcare premiums increased non-wage labor costs, while a growing number of employers in Cleveland reported passing through rising healthcare costs to their employees.",2014-03-05
97,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and based on information collected before April 7, 2014. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.                              Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest economic activity increased in most regions of the country since the previous report. The expansion was characterized as modest or moderate by the Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Chicago reported that economic growth had picked up, and New York and Philadelphia indicated that business activity had rebounded from weather-related slowdowns earlier in the year. The Cleveland and St. Louis Districts both reported a decline in economic activity.              Consumer spending increased in most Districts, as weather conditions improved and foot traffic returned. Auto sales were up in the New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts, but they were little changed from a year earlier in Kansas City and Cleveland. In addition, assessments of tourism were generally positive, particularly for the Districts of Philadelphia, Richmond, and Minneapolis, where ski resorts had record seasons. Summer bookings were also solid in several Districts. Activity was mixed at non-financial services firms, with the Boston, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts reporting increased demand. In the Boston District, for example, advertising and consulting were strong. The Richmond District indicated that revenues at non-retail services firms were flat, and St. Louis said firms' planned activity declined on net.              The transportation sector generally strengthened in recent weeks, with higher port volumes and increased trucking. Even in districts where transportation was soft, the outlook was optimistic.              Manufacturing improved in most Districts. Several Districts reported that the impact of winter weather was less severe than earlier this year. Chicago and Minneapolis saw moderate growth, while manufacturing grew at a steady pace in New York, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Dallas. San Francisco noted that manufacturing appeared to gain some momentum. Other Districts noted mild growth, except Richmond, where manufacturing activity was mixed. Demand for food production declined in the Boston, Richmond, and Dallas Districts; however the drop was primarily weather related. Steel production picked up in several districts.              Reports on residential housing markets varied. However, across most Districts, home prices rose modestly and inventory levels remained low. Residential construction increased in several Districts; only Cleveland, St. Louis, and Minneapolis reported a decrease. Commercial construction also strengthened, with the exception of Cleveland, which reported a mild decline. Commercial leasing activity generally advanced at a modest pace. Industrial markets showed signs of tightening in downstate New York and northern New Jersey.              Loan demand strengthened since the previous Beige Book. Credit quality improved in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and Kansas City Districts. New York and Dallas reported especially strong increases. New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Richmond cited the inclement weather as a factor reducing home sales and therefore mortgage borrowing. Commercial loan volumes grew in each of the Districts reporting on banking except St. Louis, where lending declined marginally.              Agricultural reports were mixed, as weather disruptions delayed crop plantings and shipments of commodities. A pig virus adversely affected hog farming in the Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. Prices of beef and pork rose. In the energy industry, oil and natural gas production increased, while coal output continued to decline.              Labor market conditions were mixed but generally positive. The New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts reported difficulty finding skilled workers.              In most Districts, wage pressures were contained or minimal. The New York District reported scattered wage pressures and Cleveland reported that wage pressures were contained. However, there were several reports of upward wage pressures in the Dallas District.              Prices were generally stable or slightly higher. The New York District described price pressures as subdued in manufacturing and steady in the service sector. In Philadelphia, manufacturing prices paid and received edged up; in Richmond, prices of raw materials and finished goods rose more slowly since the previous Beige Book. Some districts reported higher prices for construction inputs and livestock. In Cleveland, concrete, drywall, and hardwood prices rose, while in the Kansas City District, drywall and roofing prices increased and were expected to rise further.       Consumer Spending and Tourism Consumer spending increased since the previous report in a majority of Districts. Retailers reported improvement from generally weak sales at the beginning of the year that were most likely the result of winter storms. Retail sales in New York rebounded strongly from weather-depressed levels, while cold weather continued to hold down consumer spending in Cleveland. St. Louis contacts reported a number of store openings and plans for future openings. Some categories of spending benefited from the long winter, such as cold weather apparel, appliances, and snow removal equipment. Finally, Boston noted increasing online sales, and some San Francisco firms have adjusted product offerings accordingly. Retail inventories were mixed in Boston and at or near desired levels in New York. Cleveland inventories were described as being in good shape. Inventories expanded in the Chicago District, and increased moderately in Kansas City.              Sales of cars and light trucks picked up in recent weeks as the weather improved and consumer traffic returned to dealerships. Auto sales were strong in the New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, and San Francisco Districts; sales growth was moderate in Chicago. Automobile sales strengthened slightly in the Dallas District and grew modestly in Atlanta, but were flat in Kansas City. In the Cleveland District, dealers reported that winter weather continued to push down transactions.              Tourism was generally positive in the Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts. Tourism in the San Francisco District was higher than in the previous report but below year-ago levels. In New York, reports were mixed. Attendance at Broadway theaters picked up, in part because more shows were running. However, some contacts suggested that cold weather had decreased travel. In the Philadelphia, Richmond, and Minneapolis Districts, ski resorts reported an outstanding season. Atlanta reported positive tourist activity and Kansas City noted that activity picked up. Some districts were already experiencing heavy summer bookings.       Nonfinancial Services Reports on non-financial services were mixed. In the Boston District, advertising and consulting were strong, especially for healthcare consulting; firms had a positive outlook for the remainder of the year. Philadelphia's businesses were also optimistic; growth there was moderate. Activity increased in the Minneapolis District and Kansas City reported improved sales in professional, technical, and healthcare services. The Richmond District reported generally flat revenues at non-retail services firms. Chicago's nonfinancial services firms increased business spending. St. Louis reported that firms' planned activity declined on net. Reports in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts were mixed, with San Francisco noting healthy demand in the technology industry.              Transportation generally strengthened in recent weeks. In the Richmond District, container volume through ports continued to grow briskly despite winter weather disruptions. Trucking increased as firms worked to catch up with weather-delayed shipments. Atlanta ports cited increased shipments of bulk agricultural commodities and record container volumes. In addition, intermodal traffic rose modestly. Transportation firms in the Kansas City District saw slower growth in March but expected moderate growth over the next six months. Dallas transportation services firms reported mixed demand, as container and intermodal cargo decreased. Airline demand there was soft, but above year-ago levels. In the Minneapolis District, freight rail backlogs delayed agricultural shipments. Costs of freight rose while volumes declined in the Cleveland District, and operators were unable to pass through increases in diesel prices.       Manufacturing Conditions in the manufacturing sector improved since the previous Beige Book. The Chicago and Minneapolis Districts reported moderate growth, with a pickup in new orders and production. The San Francisco District stated that manufacturing activity appeared to gain some momentum. Manufacturing in the Boston, New York, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Dallas Districts grew at a steady pace, while Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Kansas City reported mild growth. Richmond reported mixed conditions in manufacturing. The Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts noted that lingering winter weather hampered business activity, but the impact was less severe than earlier this year.              The auto, aerospace, and energy-related industries remained a source of strength for the Chicago District. Energy-related manufacturing was also particularly strong in Dallas. The sustained backlog of orders for commercial aircraft supported growth in the commercial aerospace industry in the San Francisco District. The Chicago District indicated that steel production recovered from a weather-related slowdown and capacity utilization returned to its expected levels. Additionally, specialty metals manufacturers reported an increase in new orders and order backlogs. In contrast, food manufacturers in Boston, Richmond, and Dallas reported a decline in demand that was largely weather related, but indicated that production was unchanged overall. Steel shipments grew slightly in Cleveland, with contacts anticipating slow growth in the months ahead. The demand for steel production inputs improved from both domestic and foreign sources in the San Francisco District. Firms expected continued moderate growth in manufacturing, with some increased optimism.       Real Estate and Construction Reports on residential housing markets varied. Home sales in Kansas City strengthened since the last survey period due in part to seasonal factors and improved weather conditions. Moreover, in the Dallas District single-family home sales remained healthy, with some contacts reporting a seasonal pickup in demand over the past six weeks. Residential real estate improved in Richmond, with further strengthening in Northern Virginia. New York housing markets continued to be mixed, while severe winter weather hampered sales activity. Chicago reported that home sales and new listings declined, though brokers attributed this primarily to cold weather and were optimistic that activity would improve in coming months. Atlanta brokers reported homes sales were mixed and contacts attributed areas of softness to higher home prices, limited inventory, and higher mortgage rates. The pace of home sales varied across the San Francisco District. Some contacts in California noted an uptick, while contacts from Washington observed a more sluggish pace. Home sales declined across most of the largest metro areas of the St. Louis District, and Minneapolis residential real estate market activity decreased since the previous report. In most Districts, inventory levels remained limited and residential home prices rose modestly.              Residential construction grew at a moderate pace in the Boston and San Francisco Districts, while New York, Philadelphia, and Atlanta reported modest growth. In the Chicago District, a decline in single-family construction was accompanied by growing demand for new apartment projects as residential rents continued to increase. Richmond single-family home construction grew slowly. In the Kansas City District, builders reported moderate growth in the number of housing starts and expected an increase in buyer traffic and prices in the coming months. In contrast, residential construction declined in Cleveland, St. Louis, and Minneapolis. Multifamily construction remained strong in the New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. The Minneapolis District reported that overall residential construction activity decreased and that the value of residential permits fell in March.              Commercial construction activity strengthened since the previous survey period for the Kansas City and Dallas Districts. The Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts reported modest to moderate expansion in commercial construction. Philadelphia noted mild growth, while Cleveland reported a slight decline in commercial construction. Commercial leasing activity generally grew at a mild to moderate pace. Office and industrial activity remained robust in the Dallas District, with one contact noting particularly strong demand for office space in the Dallas metropolitan area. Leasing activity improved for retail and industrial space in the Richmond District. Commercial real estate contacts continued to report a decline in vacancy rates, a slight increase in absorption, and higher sales in Kansas City. The Boston, New York, and Chicago Districts reported modest commercial leasing in recent weeks. Industrial markets were generally steady across upstate New York but showed signs of tightening in downstate New York and northern New Jersey.       Banking and Financial Services On the whole, loan demand strengthened since the previous Beige Book. Of the Districts that reported on banking, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and Kansas City noted slight increases in loan volume, while Cleveland and Chicago indicated modest growth. The New York and San Francisco Districts had moderate gains. The Dallas District noted that consumer loans continued to grow moderately. St. Louis was the only district to report a decrease in loan volumes. With respect to credit quality, slight improvements were noted in Philadelphia and Cleveland, and modest advancements were made in Richmond and Kansas City. The New York and Dallas Districts reported especially strong increases. San Francisco indicated no net change in credit quality but noted that credit standards had tightened and that small business lending was primarily reserved for better-quality borrowers. Credit standards were reported to be loosening in the Atlanta District. New York, Cleveland, Richmond, and Kansas City indicated that standards were unchanged.              The majority of Districts described mixed or declining residential mortgage borrowing; only Dallas and San Francisco reported slight growth. New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Richmond cited the inclement weather as a factor reducing home sales and therefore mortgage borrowing. However, the Philadelphia District also added that bankers reported growing consumer confidence.              Commercial loan volumes grew in each of the Districts reporting on banking except St. Louis, where lending declined marginally. Overall commercial mortgage lending grew in the New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. Cleveland and Chicago saw increased lending for equipment purchases. Kansas City reported greater demand for agriculture loans. Deposits were up in the Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts but little changed in New York. Delinquency rates declined in New York and Cleveland.       Agriculture and Natural Resources Agricultural conditions varied across Districts in recent weeks. In the Chicago District, conditions improved. Kansas City and Dallas reported mild growth in the sector, while San Francisco reported stable demand for agricultural products. However, agricultural conditions weakened in the Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Districts. Adverse weather affected several districts. Winter wheat suffered as a result of dry conditions in the Kansas City District, and drought conditions continued to worsen in Dallas. In contrast, wet field conditions delayed planting in the Richmond and Atlanta Districts. Additionally, Chicago noted that the slow arrival of spring-like weather delayed fieldwork, although in some areas crops perform well after late planting. Minneapolis and San Francisco reported that winter weather disrupted transportation of some crops. In most Districts, crop prices increased in recent weeks but were below year-ago levels. Higher soybean prices shifted planting intentions away from corn. Dairy demand boomed in Dallas, especially for export, and prices for dairy products moved to record highs. Hog operations in a few Districts were battling a virus, and pork prices continued to rise. Beef prices reached record highs.              Activity in the energy industry increased modestly since the last report, with moderate growth reported by the Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. San Francisco reported a mild increase. In Kansas City, the number of active oil and natural gas drilling rigs edged up, and expectations for the coming months were positive. San Francisco reported that crude oil production increased robustly. Demand for oilfield services was very healthy in the Dallas District, particularly in West Texas. Crude oil prices generally increased. Natural gas production was stable at a high level. Minneapolis reported strong growth in natural gas and increased exploration in North Dakota. Prices of natural gas and natural gas liquids stabilized. Coal production declined at a slower rate in Cleveland and St. Louis due in part to higher demand from domestic electric utilities. The Richmond District reported steady coal production as inventories were replenished from this winter's drawdown. Cleveland and St. Louis indicated a mild decline in coal production. The Minneapolis District reported that mining was stable, with production at ore mines roughly level with a year earlier.       Employment, Wages, and Prices Recent reports on labor market conditions were mixed but generally positive. For example, the New York, Chicago, and Minneapolis Districts saw modest to moderate growth in employment. Dallas noted that transportation and manufacturing firms added jobs. Boston, however, indicated that few firms outside of advertising and consulting were hiring. Both Philadelphia and Atlanta said that firms planned to make capital expenditures to boost efficiency before they would hire. Employers in the New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts reported difficulty finding skilled workers. More specifically: New York, Richmond, and Chicago mentioned the IT field, Atlanta noted a need for truckers, Kansas City cited labor shortages for skilled positions, and Dallas reported that a food manufacturer found skilled labor in short supply.              In most Districts, wage pressures were generally portrayed as contained or minimal. For example, New York reported only scattered wage pressures and Philadelphia added that very few contacts are seeing wage pressures. In Cleveland, wage pressures were contained, Minneapolis reported that wage increases were moderate. However, Dallas cited several reports of upward wage pressures, and San Francisco added that wage gains remained quite modest overall but noted increases for certain occupations and in certain areas.              Prices were mostly steady, with scattered reports of increases. The New York District described price pressures as subdued in manufacturing and steady in the service sector. In Philadelphia manufacturing prices paid and received edged up, and in Richmond, prices of raw materials and finished goods rose more slowly since the previous Beige Book. Retail prices were steady in Boston while food prices moved up modestly in the Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco Districts. Boston reported that costs and prices increased between zero and four percent. Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts all said that prices of metals, brick, and cement rose modestly. Chicago noted that prices for corn, soybeans, dairy, hogs, and cattle increased. Kansas City also saw higher livestock prices. Prices of various categories of construction materials rose in some districts; in Cleveland, concrete, drywall, and hardwood prices all trended higher. The Kansas City District indicated that drywall and roofing prices rose and were expected to rise further. In San Francisco, wood and insulation prices edged up. Changes in natural gas prices varied: Minnesota reported increases while Dallas reported decreases as the winter weather subsided. The Cleveland District reported that spot prices for steam coal rose slightly, while the metallurgical coal price growth was flat.",2014-04-16
98,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and based on information collected on or before May 23, 2014. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.          All twelve Federal Reserve Districts report that economic activity expanded during the current reporting period. The pace of growth was characterized as moderate in the Boston, New York, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, and modest in the remaining regions. Compared with the previous report, the pace of growth picked up in the Cleveland and St. Louis Districts but slowed slightly in the Kansas City District.                  Consumer spending expanded across almost all Districts, to varying degrees. Non-auto retail sales grew at a moderate pace across most of the country: Although improved weather generally gave a boost to business, lingering wintry weather in the Northeast continued to weigh on sales in parts of the Boston and New York Districts. Increasingly strong new vehicle sales were reported by more than half the Districts, with most other regions seeing steady sales; demand was generally reported to be less robust for used vehicles than for new vehicles. Tourism was steady to stronger across most of the country--particularly in most of the eastern seaboard Districts.               Activity in the service sector, excluding finance, grew across most reporting Districts, though New York and San Francisco reported a mixed performance. Boston, Kansas City, and San Francisco noted particular strength among technology firms. Transportation activity strengthened in most Districts reporting on that sector, with Richmond and Atlanta observing brisk growth in port activity, and Cleveland noting a rebound from weather-related weakness in the prior report. Manufacturing activity expanded throughout the nation, and at an increasingly strong pace in a number of Districts--notably along the East Coast, as well as in the St. Louis and Kansas City Districts.              Residential real estate activity was mixed across the country, with some reports of low inventories constraining sales--specifically in the Boston, New York, and Kansas City Districts. Still, home prices continued to increase across most of the country, while the markets for both condos and apartment rentals were mostly robust. Residential construction activity was mixed, with half the Districts reporting increases but a few indicating some weakening in activity; multi-family construction remained particularly robust. Both non-residential construction activity and commercial real estate markets were generally steady to stronger since the last report.               Overall lending activity increased throughout the nation. Roughly two-thirds of the Districts reported rising loan demand, with particular strength reported in New York and San Francisco. Credit quality and delinquency rates generally improved, while credit standards were mostly unchanged.              Among Districts reporting on agriculture, drought conditions caused problems in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts, and, to a lesser extent, in the Chicago District; conversely, Atlanta and Minneapolis reported that excessive moisture delayed plantings. Energy industry activity strengthened in most Districts, though coal production was steady in Cleveland and declined in the Richmond District.               Labor market conditions generally strengthened in the latest reporting period, with hiring activity steady to stronger across most of the country, and several Districts reporting shortages of skilled workers. In most Districts, wage increases have remained generally subdued, though Chicago and Dallas noted increased costs for health benefits. Prices of both inputs and finished goods and services were mostly steady to up slightly.        Consumer Spending and Tourism        Consumer spending grew at a moderate pace over the latest reporting period, with a mixed performance among non-auto retailers but brisk growth in vehicle sales and moderate growth in tourism. Non-auto retail sales were characterized as mixed and generally lackluster in the Boston, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts, but growing modestly or moderately across the rest of the country. Kansas City noted some deceleration in sales. While lingering cold and wet weather was cited as somewhat of a negative factor in the Boston and New York Districts, it was characterized as less of a restraint than earlier in both these Districts and in the Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas Districts. A number of Districts also noted that the later Easter combined with the late arrival of warm weather had the effect of delaying the spring shopping season. Chicago, Kansas City and San Francisco reported relative strength in spending on home-related merchandise, while St. Louis mentioned strong restaurant business.               New vehicle sales were generally described as robust in the latest reporting period, while sales of used cars and trucks continued to lag. New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Dallas and San Francisco reported moderate to robust growth in new vehicle sales, while Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City described sales as generally steady or mixed. Cleveland and San Francisco reported some growth in sales of used vehicles, while New York reported a mixed performance. Auto dealers generally expressed optimism about the near term outlook.               Tourism was seen as fairly strong across most of the country in recent weeks. The Boston, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis Districts reported increasingly robust tourism activity, and Philadelphia noted slight growth; Dallas observed a pickup in passenger airline demand. On the other hand, tourism activity was seen weakening somewhat in the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts. New York and Philadelphia attributed some of the pickup to the marked improvement in weather driving pent-up demand, Boston credited the 2014 Marathon for much of the strength in April, and Atlanta cited strength in international visitors.       Nonfinancial Services        Nonfinancial services activity generally strengthened since the previous report. The Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts reported that service-sector activity expanded, on balance, while such activity was reported to be mixed in the New York and San Francisco Districts. St. Louis noted that reports of planned service sector activity have been positive. Business activity strengthened for technology service firms in the Boston, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, while Dallas reported that demand for accounting services remained steady at a high level. Activity in the food services industry continued to decline in the San Francisco District.              Reports on goods transportation services were largely positive. Increased shipments and cargo volumes were noted in the Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Following a difficult winter, contacts in Cleveland reported strengthening demand for shipments of motor vehicles, chemical products, and construction-related materials. Port activity grew briskly in the Richmond and Atlanta Districts, particularly for auto-related products and containerized cargo. Railroad shipments increased in the Atlanta and Minneapolis Districts, while intermodal traffic expanded in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts. Airline passenger demand improved in the Dallas District.       Manufacturing        Manufacturing activity expanded in all twelve Districts since the previous report, with a pickup in the pace of growth reported in several Districts. Activity expanded robustly in the Boston, New York, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts, while a more modest pace of growth was reported by Chicago, St. Louis, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Dallas, and Minneapolis. Activity expanded more slowly in the Richmond and San Francisco Districts. Growth was especially strong for several Districts in activity related to motor vehicles, aerospace, and metals. By contrast, construction-related manufacturing activity was mixed. Philadelphia reported weakness in this sector, and Chicago and Kansas City noted some strength, while demand for construction-related materials was mixed in the Dallas District. Demand for semiconductors increased modestly in the San Francisco District. Chicago and Cleveland noted strength in energy-related industries, and refinery utilization rates rose in the Dallas District. Steel production was up slightly in Cleveland, where activity related to oil and gas was also reported to be strong. The Richmond District noted declining sales for machinery, textiles, rubber and plastics, and San Francisco noted a slowing in the pace of new orders among defense-related manufacturers.       Real Estate and Construction        Residential real estate activity has been mixed since the last report, with a lack of inventory at times cited as a constraining factor. Boston, New York, and Kansas City indicated that existing home sales were being held back due to low or dwindling inventories. Sales rose modestly in the Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas Districts, with inventories described as low in Richmond and Chicago and declining in Cleveland. Sales activity, however, softened in the Philadelphia, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts, though Philadelphia did note some signs of improvement in May. San Francisco attributed some of the weakness to severe weather. Home prices continued to increase across most of the Districts; Boston reported some pullback in prices of single-family homes, though condo prices in that District, as well as in New York, rose. New York, Chicago, and Dallas reported strengthening demand for apartment rentals, whereas Boston noted some slackening in demand.               Homebuilders gave mixed reports on new home sales and construction in recent weeks: Residential construction strengthened, to varying degrees in the New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. However, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Minneapolis indicated some weakening in new home sales and construction. Overall residential construction activity was mixed across the San Francisco District, though contacts there expect activity will increase over the next year. Both Boston and New York reported a good deal of recent multi-family development at the high end of the market, while Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas noted strength in multi-family construction more generally.               Non-residential construction activity was steady to stronger in most Districts over the latest reporting period, with strengthening reported in the Boston, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts. Cleveland described pipeline activity as strong, and San Francisco noted that a number of public and commercial high rise projects have been announced or are underway. In contrast, Minneapolis reported a decline in non-residential construction activity, and Philadelphia characterized it as steady at a low level; Chicago described activity as mixed--with office construction weak but industrial and some segments of retail fairly strong. The commercial real estate market was mostly stronger since the last report. Leasing activity and vacancy rates improved in the Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, and were generally steady in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and St. Louis Districts. Dallas described market conditions as robust.       Banking and Financial Services        All Districts reporting on banking noted that lending activity increased. Loan demand was reported as strong by New York and San Francisco, while more modest growth was reported by Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas. Commercial and industrial loans grew in the Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts. On the consumer lending side, several Districts noted that the demand for auto loans was particularly strong, including Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco, though such lending was reported to be up only slightly in the St. Louis District. Residential real estate lending increased in the Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts, while mortgage lending activity was reported as holding steady in the Atlanta and San Francisco Districts. By contrast, both Cleveland and Richmond reported slightly weaker mortgage lending activity, and New York and Richmond reported a decline in mortgage refinancing.              Credit quality was reported as strong in the San Francisco District, loan quality improved in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts, and delinquency rates were somewhat lower in the New York, Cleveland, and St. Louis Districts. Credit quality was reported as stable by Richmond and Kansas City. Credit standards were seen as largely unchanged in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Kansas City Districts, while St. Louis reported that credit standards for commercial and industrial loans had eased slightly.       Agriculture and Natural Resources        Agriculture conditions proved challenging in many Districts, with drought conditions reported by some Districts and excessive moisture reported in others. Drought conditions existed in parts of the San Francisco District, particularly in California and Arizona, resulting in a reduction in crop plantings and reduced herd sizes. Dallas also noted widespread drought conditions, especially in the Texas panhandle, as did the Chicago District in parts of Iowa. On the other hand, rains delayed plantings of crops in parts of the Atlanta and Minneapolis Districts. Planting progressed well overall in the Chicago District and in Idaho as reported by San Francisco. Minneapolis and San Francisco reported a loss of hogs due to a fatal virus, contributing to higher hog prices. More generally, low cattle supplies and strong demand resulted in high beef prices in Minneapolis and Kansas City. Both Kansas City and Dallas reported problems with the quality and quantity of the winter wheat crop, though winter wheat crops were generally in good condition in the St. Louis District.               Activity in the energy industry generally increased since the previous report. Atlanta and San Francisco reported that crude oil production expanded strongly, and Dallas noted that the demand for oilfield services was robust. Natural gas production climbed in the Richmond and Atlanta Districts. Minneapolis highlighted a number of recent or planned projects to expand energy production capacity. St. Louis reported that coal production was up from year ago levels, while coal production held steady in the Cleveland District but fell in the Richmond District.        Employment, Wages, and Prices        Labor market conditions generally improved since the previous report. The Boston, New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts indicated that employment levels were flat to up modestly. Philadelphia reported that some new hiring occurred but noted that firms remain cautious, while improvement in the labor market has led to increased competition for workers in the Kansas City District. Contacts in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts noted an increase in demand for some temporary workers, while the Atlanta District reported a small increase in workers transitioning from temporary to permanent positions. Several Districts continued to report that employers were having difficulty finding skilled workers.              Most Districts reported that wage pressures remained subdued since the previous report, although an increase in the cost of health insurance was noted in Chicago and Dallas. According to reports from the New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, to the extent that wage increases were observed, they were concentrated among highly skilled workers in information technology, engineering, professional services, and some of the skilled trades.              Price pressures were said to be contained, as most Districts reported that both input and finished goods prices were little changed or up only slightly since the previous report. However, high or rising prices for some agricultural commodities, construction materials, energy products, and precious metals were cited by some Districts. Contacts in the Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts noted higher food prices, particularly for meat and dairy products. By contrast, Chicago reported that corn, wheat, and hog prices declined, and Dallas reported that fuel costs declined for a transportation services firm.",2014-06-04
99,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and based on information collected before July 7, 2014. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.          All twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that economic activity continued to expand since the previous report. The pace of economic growth was characterized as moderate in New York, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco, while the remaining Districts reported modest expansion. Compared to the previous reporting period, Boston and Richmond noted a slightly slower pace of growth. Most Districts were optimistic about the outlook for growth.                  Overall consumer spending increased in every District. Retail sales grew modestly in most Districts, with increases that were generally similar to the previous reporting period. Vehicle sales remained stronger than non-auto retail sales, with Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco indicating robust to very strong auto sales. Tourism activity expanded in all reporting Districts, with growth ranging from slight in Philadelphia to very strong in Boston. Hotel contacts described robust activity in the Boston, New York, Atlanta, and Minneapolis Districts, while Philadelphia and Richmond noted activity levels that were in line with seasonal norms.              Activity in the nonfinancial services sector continued to grow across all Districts at a modest to moderate pace. Many Districts reported positive growth for professional and business services, including healthcare consulting, advertising, engineering, accounting, and technology. Overall, transportation activity rose at a moderate pace since the previous survey period. Broad-based demand for trucking and rail services across the Districts increased, and the Richmond District reported strong growth in port container traffic, with increases in both imports and exports. Manufacturing activity expanded in all twelve Districts. Contacts in the metal and auto industries generally reported positive growth, while manufacturers in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and Chicago Districts reported increased demand for their products from the energy sector.              Reports on real estate activity varied across the Districts. Many Districts reported low inventories and increasing home prices, but demand was mixed. Boston, New York, and St. Louis reported home sales were below year-ago levels, while Chicago noted a decrease in home sales since the last survey period. Home sales in other Districts remained steady or increased. Multi-family sales and leasing activity were robust in the New York and Dallas Districts. Residential construction rose for single-family homes in the Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, while New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco reported increases for multifamily construction. Commercial construction activity generally strengthened across the Districts, due to higher demand and low vacancy rates.              Loan volumes rose across the nation, with slight to moderate increases reported in most Districts. Credit quality remained stable or improved slightly in most Districts, while San Francisco noted a slight decline. Credit standards were generally unchanged, although Richmond noted an easing of cost terms for well-qualified commercial and industrial borrowers, and Philadelphia and Chicago mentioned that competitive pressures were leading some financial institutions to take on higher credit risks.              Among Districts reporting on agriculture, heavy rains improved soil moisture levels in the Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts, while drought conditions persisted in San Francisco. Most fall crops were reported in good or better condition, and expectations of higher production lowered crop prices. Profitability improved for livestock operators in the Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts due to high cattle and hog prices. Oil production expanded in the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts, while natural gas and coal production remained relatively steady in reporting Districts.              Labor market conditions improved, as all twelve Districts reported slight to moderate employment growth. Several Districts continued to report some difficulty finding workers for skilled positions. Aside from higher wages to attract talent for these skilled positions, wage pressures remained modest in most Districts. Price pressures were generally contained, with most Districts reporting slight to modest price increases for both inputs and finished goods. Several Districts noted higher prices for meat, dairy products, construction materials, and some metals (namely steel, copper, and nickel).       Consumer Spending and Tourism        Consumer spending continued to increase at a moderate pace since the previous report, with generally modest growth among non-auto retailers and moderate to strong growth in vehicle sales and tourism activity. Most Districts reported modest retail sales growth since the last report, with slightly slower sales growth in the Boston and Atlanta Districts and faster sales growth in the New York, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Although wet weather continued to restrain sales in the Chicago District, New York noted an increase in sales due to pent-up demand as the negative effects from earlier adverse weather abated. Several Districts mentioned that higher meat prices were affecting consumer behavior. New York, Cleveland, and Chicago also reported higher levels of promotions or discounting. Sales were particularly strong for shoes and children's apparel in the Philadelphia District, furniture in the Atlanta District, home improvement and building materials in the St. Louis and Kansas City Districts, and low-end and mid-range technology goods in the San Francisco District. Contacts in the Philadelphia and Cleveland Districts reported higher planned capital expenditures for retail space.              Vehicle sales expanded in most Districts in the latest reporting period, and auto contacts were optimistic about auto sales in the months ahead. Most Districts reported that sales were above year-ago levels, with Dallas noting a return to pre-recession sales levels. Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco reported robust or very strong auto sales growth, while most other Districts noted a more moderate pace of growth. Cleveland, Richmond, and San Francisco reported some softening in used car sales, while new car sales were stronger than used sales. Richmond mentioned that recent vehicle recalls were weighing on used car sales, while Chicago noted increased activity in service and parts departments due to recalls. SUVs sold particularly well in the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts.              Tourism activity increased across all reporting Districts, and most Districts' contacts were optimistic about future activity levels. Boston, New York, and Kansas City reported strong tourism activity, while Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San Francisco reported moderate tourism growth. Hotel occupancy rates were high in the Boston, New York, Atlanta, and Minneapolis Districts. Tourism activity rose slightly in the Philadelphia and Richmond Districts, with levels that were in line with seasonal norms. Philadelphia and Richmond also mentioned that many tourists were budget conscious. Dallas noted gains in domestic travel, but weaker demand from foreign travelers.       Nonfinancial Services        Nonfinancial services activity continued to strengthen since the previous survey period, with all Districts reporting steady or improving growth. Many Districts reported positive growth within the professional and business services sector. Specifically, Boston noted an increase in demand for consulting services (especially for healthcare) and advertising; Richmond indicated a rise in demand for accounting services; Minneapolis mentioned gains in engineering and architecture services; and San Francisco noted an increase in technology services. San Francisco continued to report a decline in activity in the food services industry. Conditions in the staffing services industry across the Districts were unchanged or improved modestly compared with the previous survey period.              Transportation activity grew at a moderate pace in the most recent survey period. Minneapolis and Dallas reported high demand for rail services; in particular, Minneapolis mentioned increased volumes for grain, crushed stone, lumber, and wood, although rail shipments for petroleum, primary forest materials, and nonmetallic minerals decreased. Contacts in the Cleveland District reported strong and broad-based trucking activity, with shipments of construction and fracking-related materials particularly strong. Contacts in the Richmond District noted an increase in demand for freight trucking related to home improvement stores increasing inventories in advance of the Fourth of July holiday weekend. Port officials in the Richmond District saw robust growth in container traffic, led by exports of forest products, grains, soybeans, and auto parts, and imports of auto parts, apparel, and textiles. However, these contacts also noted that imports of housing-related products, such as furniture and appliances, had decelerated.       Manufacturing        Manufacturing activity expanded further in all twelve Districts since the previous survey period, with growth occurring across many subsectors. Manufacturing activity in the New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts grew at a robust pace, while the manufacturing sectors in the Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts increased at a more modest pace. Compared with the previous report, the pace of growth slowed slightly in the Boston, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts, and increased in the Richmond District. Contacts in the Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported generally positive activity within the metals sector. Philadelphia and Chicago noted improved growth in the aerospace industry since the previous survey period. Manufacturing in the auto industry generally strengthened, with Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco reporting increased activity; however, Minneapolis noted a moderation in the auto industry's demand for certain inputs. Manufacturers supporting the energy sector in the Midwest and Northern Appalachia reported stronger sales, specifically for metal-piping related products. Production of construction inputs was mixed, as Kansas City and San Francisco reported a decrease in production and Philadelphia, Chicago, and Dallas reported a slight increase. Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas were optimistic about the near-term outlook for overall manufacturing activity.       Real Estate and Construction        Residential real estate activity continued to vary by Federal Reserve District, reflecting generally low inventories and mixed levels of demand. Specifically, Boston, New York, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas noted that residential home sales were constrained by low or dwindling inventories. Nevertheless, despite decreasing inventories, residential home sales in the Atlanta and Kansas City Districts rose at a slight to modest pace. Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Richmond also noted a slight to modest increase in sales since the previous survey period, while San Francisco reported that home sales in the recent reporting period were below year-ago levels. Boston, New York, Chicago, and St. Louis indicated that residential sales activity softened, with Chicago attributing some of this decline to an increase in prices. Home prices continued to rise across most of the Districts, especially within urban areas, but contacts in the San Francisco District noted a slightly slower pace of home price appreciation. New York and Dallas reported robust activity in multifamily sales and leasing.              Residential construction activity generally increased across the Districts, with only St. Louis and Minneapolis reporting a decline in overall activity. Chicago and San Francisco reported increased construction of high-end urban single-family homes, and Cleveland and Kansas City continued to see growth in low- to medium-priced single-family construction. Cleveland and San Francisco reported that a shortage of vacant lots was holding back further growth in both single-family and multifamily construction; however, growth remained positive. New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco noted that multifamily construction activity increased since the previous survey period. Contacts in the Cleveland District reported that they were seeing greater willingness to finance multifamily projects.              Commercial construction activity strengthened across most Districts. Cleveland and Atlanta reported increased commercial construction activity compared to a year ago, and Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco noted gains since the previous survey period. Boston and Richmond saw mixed commercial construction activity across their Districts since the previous report. Dallas indicated strong overall commercial real estate construction activity, and commercial real estate construction increased in the Minneapolis District compared with the previous report. Boston, New York, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas reported tight commercial vacancy rates. Industrial real estate construction and leasing activity was strong in the Philadelphia and Chicago Districts.       Banking and Financial Services        Overall, banking conditions improved slightly from the previous reporting period. Nearly all reporting Districts indicated increasing loan volumes. Loan demand was strongest in the New York, Chicago, and Dallas Districts, where loan volumes rose moderately compared with the previous report. Loan volumes increased modestly in the Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts, while Philadelphia and Cleveland noted a slight uptick. Commercial and industrial lending increased in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts. However, commercial and industrial lending decreased slightly in the Kansas City District. Commercial real estate lending exhibited slight to moderate growth in the New York, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Growth in residential real estate loan volumes was mixed across the System. New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Dallas reported growth, while Richmond, Atlanta, and Kansas City indicated slight declines in demand. Consumer lending increased in the New York, Philadelphia and St. Louis Districts, and construction lending expanded in the New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco Districts. Most Districts cited stable or slight improvement in credit quality, while Dallas and New York reported moderate and strong improvement, respectively. San Francisco was the only District with a reported decline in credit quality. Bankers in the New York and Atlanta Districts reported decreases in delinquency rates for all loan categories, with rates reaching pre-recession levels in the Atlanta District.              Credit standards remained generally unchanged in most Districts. Contacts in the Philadelphia District expressed a growing concern for loans with risky terms as a result of strong competition among banks to secure new loans. In addition, banking contacts in the Chicago District cited competitive pressure on structure and pricing for traditional and leveraged business lending, particularly from nonbank financial institutions willing to take on higher credit risk. Though Richmond indicated an easing of cost terms for well-qualified commercial and industrial borrowers, credit standards for mortgage lending were described as strict.              Deposit volumes picked up in the Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts, but declined in the St. Louis District. New York indicated declining spreads between loan rates and cost of funds, particularly for commercial mortgages. Bank contacts in the Philadelphia District reported growing confidence among both businesses and consumers, but also indicated that businesses continued to be cautious regarding most decisions.       Agriculture and Natural Resources        Growing conditions varied with precipitation levels. Heavy rains improved soil moisture levels in the Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts, though there were isolated reports of hail and flood damage. However, recent rains were too late to aid the development of the winter wheat crop and actually delayed the harvest in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts, leading to expectations for below-average yields. Persistent drought in the San Francisco District led some producers to curb new planting to conserve water for permanent crops. Despite late planting in many areas, most fall crops were reported in good or better condition, and expectations of strong production this year lowered crop prices. High cattle and hog prices, reflecting supply constraints and strong export demand, improved profitability for livestock operators in the Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Higher milk prices and low feed costs relative to last year also strengthened profit margins for dairy operators in the Minneapolis and San Francisco Districts. The Chicago District reported declines in milk and cattle prices compared with the previous survey period, though prices remained well above levels necessary to cover production costs.              Oil production drove growth in the energy sector, while natural gas and coal production generally held steady. Strong summer demand was expected to support elevated oil prices. Oil production expanded in the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts, and crude oil inventories rose at Gulf Coast refineries in the Atlanta District. Natural gas production in the Richmond and Kansas City Districts remained relatively steady. Some contacts in the Kansas City District planned to increase capital spending, and also noted a rise in drilling costs due to advances in technology. Coal production in the Cleveland, Richmond, and St. Louis Districts, as well as iron ore output in the Minneapolis District, was little changed.       Employment, Wages, and Prices        Labor market conditions continued to improve since the previous report, with all Districts reporting slight to moderate employment growth. Employers in the Philadelphia District remained cautious, and reported hiring for replacement and some incremental growth. Philadelphia and Atlanta reported more hiring for permanent positions since the last reporting period. Employers in the Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts reported difficulty finding workers for some skilled positions. In particular, a shortage of truck drivers was noted in the Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta and Kansas City Districts, and skilled construction and craft workers were reportedly in short supply in the Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City and Dallas Districts. Cleveland and Dallas also noted that labor markets were tight in energy-producing areas.              Most Districts noted that wage pressures remained modest outside of some skilled positions. New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and Atlanta reported stable to slightly increasing wage pressures; in addition, Chicago indicated that wage pressures increased (though primarily for skilled workers). St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City reported modest wage pressures. Wage pressures in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts were moderately higher than in other parts of the country. Dallas noted that the strongest wage pressures within its District were in the energy and construction sectors, but reported modest upward pressure in other industries as well. San Francisco mentioned some upward wage pressure from rising minimum wages, and some contacts in the San Francisco District noted an increasing need to offer higher starting salaries to attract talent from competitors.              Price pressures were generally contained, with most Districts reporting slight to modest price increases for both inputs and finished goods. New York and Chicago reported upward pressure on costs; Richmond and Kansas City reported that prices of raw materials and finished goods rose at a slightly slower pace. Several Districts noted higher prices for meat, dairy products, construction materials, fuel, and some metals (namely steel, copper, and nickel). Contacts in the Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported success in passing on higher input costs to customers in some instances.",2014-07-16
100,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and based on information collected on or before August 22, 2014. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.          Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that economic activity has expanded since the previous Beige Book report; however, none of the Districts pointed to a distinct shift in the overall pace of growth. The New York, Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts characterized their growth rates as moderate; Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City reported modest growth. Boston reported that business activity appeared to be improving, and Richmond reported further strengthening. Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas explicitly reported that contacts in their Districts generally remained optimistic about future growth; most of the other Districts cited various examples of ongoing optimism from specific sectors.                  General consumer spending grew in most Districts at rates ranging from slight to moderate, with few changes in the pace of growth compared with the last Beige Book. Most Districts reported a continued expansion of auto sales, noting record-high levels for several markets within the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts; however, in some parts of the New York and Philadelphia Districts sales began to fall back from their relatively high levels. Tourism activity was reported to have increased across much of the nation, with many Districts reporting higher hotel booking and occupancy rates.              Activity among nonfinancial service sectors improved overall. District reports on manufacturing were mixed--divided almost evenly into one of three characterizations of the sector's activity: expanding, contracting, or unchanged. Among Districts reporting on their firms' near-term expectations, the manufacturing outlook remained generally upbeat, with New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, and Atlanta reporting increased optimism.              Since the previous Beige Book, residential real estate activity, particularly sales of existing homes and construction of new homes, generally expanded or held steady in about half of the Districts. About half of the Districts also reported some growth in construction and in sales or leasing of nonresidential properties.              Overall, loan demand rose in eight Districts and held steady in one. Credit standards were largely unchanged. Six Districts reported improving credit quality, falling delinquency rates, or both.              Reports regarding farm products were mixed; for some crops, high anticipated harvests have put downward pressure on prices and expected farm incomes. Generally, oil and gas production and demand for related activities continued to edge up from already high levels, while total coal production mostly held steady.              Trends in employment, wages, and prices were relatively unchanged in the Federal Reserve Districts, with greater wage pressures reported in sectors where shortages of skilled labor persisted.       Consumer Spending and Tourism        Most Districts reported some growth in consumer spending with a pace of growth characterized as ranging from slight to moderate. Compared with the last Beige Book, the Chicago District noted a pickup in growth; Philadelphia indicated somewhat slower growth; and merchants in the Atlanta District reported that sales had weakened slightly. San Francisco contacts suggested that consumers appeared more optimistic about the recovery, New York reported mixed consumer confidence, and Cleveland and Richmond indicated that consumers were being conservative in their discretionary spending. Strong sales were noted for clothing and apparel in Boston and Chicago; household and home improvement categories in Boston and Kansas City; electronics in San Francisco; and back-to-school items in New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Dallas. Cleveland also noted that some retailers have seen a significant rise in online shopping.              Since the previous Beige Book, auto industry contacts in most reporting Districts have noted continued expansion, with sales at high levels. In the Philadelphia District, Pennsylvania dealers claimed statewide record auto sales in July, as did an auto dealer in Dallas. However, sales in Pennsylvania began to back off their highs in August. Likewise, New York reported mixed results from some upstate auto dealers. Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco noted increased sales of SUVs and pickup trucks. Some Cleveland contacts attributed rising truck sales to a stronger construction industry, while contacts in San Francisco cited a decline in fuel prices as a factor. Inventory levels were mixed among reporting Districts, declining slightly in Kansas City, remaining at or above desired levels in St. Louis, and building up in Cleveland.              Tourism activity increased in all reporting Districts. Hotel occupancy rates remained high or rose in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts. San Francisco reported that strength in visitor volume in Las Vegas was due more to convention attendance than to tourism, and Richmond cited group bookings for business and reunion events as sources of strength. Most reporting Districts indicated optimism about future activity levels, with Boston, Richmond, and San Francisco reporting strong advance hotel bookings through the fall.       Nonfinancial Services        On balance, nonfinancial services have grown since the previous Beige Book. The Boston District reported strong demand for software and information technology services, with contacts attributing this strength to continued economic recovery and robust demand for software products. New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco firms reported moderate growth, and providers of professional business services in Minneapolis reported increased activity. Richmond, St. Louis, and Dallas reported modest growth in services, and Kansas City reported stable sales growth for professional and high-tech services firms. Conditions for staffing services were generally positive across reporting Districts. Staffing activity generally increased in Boston, and staffing contacts in Philadelphia noted increases in new clients and firms hiring to grow their businesses. Dallas reported mixed demand from staffing firms, noting strength in engineering, information technology, and health-care positions but flat demand for legal services.              Districts reporting on transportation services generally noted growth. Cleveland, Atlanta, and Dallas reported moderate to strong freight volumes. Richmond contacts attributed some recent growth in port activity to ships diverted from West Coast ports and to an early arrival of the peak import season. Kansas City transportation firms reported stable sales growth and continued high demand for construction products. Cleveland noted that amid broad-based demand strength, shipments of consumer durables and energy-related commodities and materials stood out. Dallas cited notable growth in shipping volumes for steel. Contacts from New York, Cleveland, and Atlanta mentioned driver shortages or difficulties finding qualified drivers, and contacts in Cleveland, Richmond, and Atlanta noted concerns about capacity for various types of transportation.       Manufacturing        Since the last Beige Book period, the Cleveland, Richmond, and Dallas Districts reported that manufacturing activity has expanded; New York, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City indicated that their growth rates had moderated somewhat. San Francisco cited mixed reports from a variety of contacts. Boston, Philadelphia, and Chicago reported continued growth.              Within manufacturing, growth was reported across a broad base of sectors. Increases in auto production or derived demand for steel and other related products were cited by Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas. San Francisco cited increases in steel capacity utilization over recent months. Cleveland cited slightly lower steel shipments because of seasonal factors but indicated underlying demand was strong. Construction was cited as a source of increased demand by manufacturing contacts in the Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts. Chicago reported that demand for heavy machinery picked up some on net, as higher demand for construction machinery overshadowed weakness for agricultural and mining machinery. Firms in the Boston District reported strengthening demand for semiconductors, while San Francisco reported that demand for semiconductors strengthened in part because of robust orders from other countries. With the exception of motor vehicle producers, manufacturers in the Atlanta District generally reported weakness in new orders and shipments. Manufacturing associated with the energy sector was cited as a continued source of growth by Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Dallas.              Contacts in most Districts expressed optimism about the near-term outlook for manufacturing growth. Moreover, in the New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, and Atlanta Districts, optimism reportedly increased in comparison with the previous reporting period. Boston and Cleveland reported that current capital spending is roughly in line with earlier plans. Kansas City indicated slightly diminished capital spending plans, but the outlook remained solidly positive across contacts.       Real Estate and Construction        Barely half of the Districts reported stable or growing residential real estate activity related to the construction of new homes and sales of existing houses. New construction and existing home sales generally grew modestly; market conditions tended to vary by metropolitan area and by neighborhood within metropolitan areas. Boston, New York, and Dallas reported high levels of ongoing multifamily construction projects; Chicago reported a moderate pace of growth, and San Francisco noted a pickup in activity.              A little over half of the Districts reported some degree of growth in nonresidential real estate activity, with increased construction, leasing, or both tied to steady or falling vacancy rates and to rent increases. None of the Districts reported a decline in overall activity, although New York and St. Louis described activity as mixed. In addition to traditional office space, certain Districts reported increased demand for specific projects: Boston noted demand for construction in the hospitality sector, Philadelphia cited industrial and warehouse projects, Richmond noted distribution centers, and St. Louis reported new retail and mixed-use projects as well as new industrial facility construction.       Banking and Finance        Overall, banking conditions continued to improve from the prior Beige Book period. Loan volumes increased in nearly all reporting Districts, led by moderate gains in the San Francisco District and modest gains in Chicago. Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Dallas noted slight gains; Kansas City reported steady demand. Lending volumes rose in Richmond and appeared to increase, on net, in New York and Cleveland.              Auto lending was the category most often cited as growing. The Cleveland and Atlanta Districts reported very strong auto loan demand, while Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco also noted growth in this category. In addition, Philadelphia, Chicago, and St. Louis reported growth in credit card borrowing. San Francisco also noted a slight increase in unsecured consumer credit. New York and Cleveland reported that overall consumer loans had leveled off, while consumer installment loans were described as somewhat softer in the Kansas City District. Philadelphia and San Francisco reported increasing usage of home equity lines of credit, while slightly less usage was reported in the Cleveland District.              Demand for business credit expanded in most reporting Districts. Commercial and industrial (C&I) lending increased in the New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas Districts; reports from the Philadelphia District were mixed. Cleveland reported that demand for C&I loans was greatest from manufacturers, energy producers, and health-care providers; Dallas also noted demand related to energy projects. Commercial real estate lending exhibited slight to moderate growth in the New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts; Philadelphia and Dallas reported no change; and volumes in the Kansas City District decreased slightly.              Demand for residential mortgages was less robust; only the Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas Districts reported increases (which were typically only slight), and New York, Cleveland, St. Louis, and Kansas City reported no change or slight decreases. Cleveland did note some increase in refinancing loans, as did Richmond; however, New York and Philadelphia reported continued declines in this loan category.              The Philadelphia, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported that credit quality improved further, while New York and Cleveland stated that delinquency rates fell across all loan categories. A survey of St. Louis District banks showed improved creditworthiness of applicants and unchanged or slightly lower delinquencies for several loan categories.              Credit standards remained generally unchanged in most Districts. Bankers in the Atlanta District reported that they were well capitalized but remained cautious about residential lending and fiercely competitive over commercial lending. Contacts in the Richmond and San Francisco Districts described intense competition among lenders for customers with high-quality credit. Philadelphia and Cleveland also reported heated competition. However, according to Atlanta District contacts, standards remained especially rigorous for first-time homebuyers.       Agriculture and Natural Resources        Farming contacts in many Districts have reported record-high crop yields, resulting in declines in market prices for cotton, corn, soybeans, and other agricultural commodities. The lower prices have resulted in lower expected incomes for some crop producers while reducing feed costs for some livestock producers. Dallas reported that historically high cattle prices have slowed the efforts of cattle producers to rebuild their herds. Chicago reported that hog and cattle prices have slipped during this Beige Book period; however, higher milk prices have helped the livestock sector stay profitable. Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco reported some drought-related disruptions. San Francisco reported higher shipping costs among growers because locomotives were being diverted to the Midwest to haul oil and gas rail cars to refineries in Texas.              Activity in the energy sector was generally positive. Oil and gas production and related activities continued to edge higher from already high levels, and total coal production was mostly steady. The Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts reported modest to brisk growth in activities related to oil production (refining, exploration, drilling, rigging, and oil field and geological services). Producers in the Kansas City District indicated that slightly lower oil prices have not negatively affected drilling plans. In contrast, coal production was reported to be relatively stable in the Cleveland and Richmond Districts; St. Louis pointed to modest growth. Richmond reported a modest decline in coal prices, and Cleveland described spot coal prices as remaining depressed. In addition, Cleveland indicated that activity in the Marcellus and Utica shale fields was continuing relatively unchanged at a high level.       Employment, Wages, and Prices        Labor market conditions, as measured by hiring trends, were reported to be relatively unchanged from generally modest rates in most Districts; however, contacts in nearly all Districts reported difficulties finding certain types of skilled labor. Contacts cited shortages of skilled information technology workers in the Boston District, of truck drivers in New York, and of construction workers in Atlanta. Employment agencies in New York described the job market as strengthening, and some Dallas contacts noted that the labor market remains very tight in the energy sector. Contacts in Cleveland, Richmond, and San Francisco also mentioned challenges finding qualified workers. Staffing contacts in Philadelphia reported that some of their clients are hiring to grow their businesses.              Generally, Districts reported little change in wage pressures, which were commonly characterized as slight or modest. Richmond was an exception, reporting that wage growth slowed in the manufacturing and service sectors. Stronger wage pressure was reported for specific categories of skilled workers. In particular, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco noted greater wage pressure for jobs in energy, construction, trucking, manufacturing, engineering, information technology, finance, and health care, among others. Some general contractors in the Cleveland District reported that they have increased wages and upgraded benefit plans as a means of attracting and retaining skilled workers.              Overall, price pressures remained largely unchanged. Input prices were described as modest, stable, or benign in reports from Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City. Chicago noted that prices fell for corn, soybeans, hogs, and cattle but rose for milk during the current Beige Book period. San Francisco cited higher building supply prices, Minneapolis cited higher prices for some metals, and Chicago noted that energy prices generally remained elevated. Cleveland District contacts in the manufacturing and freight transportation sectors noted some ability to pass higher input prices through to customers with little pushback. By contrast, only a few companies in the Atlanta District noted plans to increase prices over the remainder of the year and expressed confidence that any increases would stick.",2014-09-03
101,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and based on information collected before October 6, 2014. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.          Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts generally described modest to moderate economic growth at a pace similar to that noted in the previous Beige Book. Moderate growth was reported by the Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, while modest growth was reported by the New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts. In the Boston District, reports from business contacts painted a mixed picture of economic conditions. In addition, several Districts noted that contacts were generally optimistic about future activity.                  Most Districts reported overall growth in consumer spending that ranged from slight to moderate, at a pace that was often similar to that reported in the previous Beige Book. However, general merchandise retailers in New York noted that sales were weaker on balance since the previous report. Several District reports indicated that retailers were relatively optimistic about the remainder of the year. Meanwhile, tourism activity remained upbeat in several areas, with some reports of higher occupancy rates and solid advance bookings for travel and lodging.              Several Districts reported that nonfinancial services grew at a moderate pace since the previous Beige Book. Districts reporting on transportation services generally noted growth in this sector, with a few pointing to capacity constraints in railroads, trucking, or both. Manufacturing activity increased in most Districts since the previous Beige Book; contacts in the Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts reported positive near-term outlooks.              Residential construction and real estate activity were mixed since the previous report. Commercial construction and real estate activity grew in most Districts. Banking conditions continued to improve relative to the previous Beige Book. Commercial loan volumes increased in nearly all reporting Districts. However, consumer loan demand was mixed, and some Districts pointed to low or reduced levels of demand for refinancing. Credit standards generally remained unchanged, and there were no reports of deterioration in credit quality.              Agricultural conditions were mixed since the previous Beige Book. Prices for some crops declined, driven in part by very strong realized or anticipated production. These lower prices for some agricultural commodities were seen as weighing on producers' incomes, but as benefiting those using the commodities as inputs. In the energy sector, coal production was mixed and oil and natural gas production generally increased from already-high levels.              Employment continued to expand at about the same pace as that reported in the previous Beige Book. Most Districts reported that some employers had difficulty finding qualified workers for certain positions. A number of Districts characterized overall wage growth as modest, but reported upward wage pressures for particular industries and occupations, such as skilled labor in construction and manufacturing.              Consistent with the previous Beige Book, price pressures remained subdued, with Districts reporting little to no change in price levels or modest increases. Firms generally reported that input prices were unchanged or up slightly.       Consumer Spending and Tourism        Most Districts described growth in consumer spending as slight to moderate, and at a pace roughly similar to that reported in the previous Beige Book. In particular, the Boston, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts reported moderate growth; Philadelphia reported only slight growth in non-auto retail sales, and retailers in the Atlanta and San Francisco Districts also cited a slight improvement in sales. General merchandise sales in the New York District were weaker on balance since the previous report. Boston, New York, and Chicago reported that inventories were at desired levels. In Philadelphia, many retailers were avoiding the need for deeper discounting; however, New York and Cleveland reported that some contacts were running more promotions than usual. Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco indicated that retail contacts were relatively optimistic about the remainder of the year. In Chicago and Dallas, retailers were expecting that sales during the upcoming holiday shopping season would be up slightly from a year earlier.              Growth in auto sales varied across Districts, but was generally positive. In the New York District auto dealers reported that sales were steady to slightly stronger, while sales increased modestly in the Kansas City District. Auto dealers continued to report strong growth in the Philadelphia District. Lower gas prices spurred sales of larger vehicles in the Chicago District. Cleveland reported that new auto sales were down slightly in August from a year ago, but year-to-date sales were higher than the same period last year. Cleveland and Kansas City also reported solid sales of larger vehicles, such as light trucks and SUVs. In the Kansas City District, auto inventories fell; in Cleveland, inventory reports were mixed. Dallas reported that contacts were satisfied with their inventory levels. Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas noted that dealers were optimistic about sales prospects for the rest of the year.              Tourism activity was relatively solid in several areas, with upbeat reports from the Boston, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, and Minneapolis Districts. In the Kansas City District, tourism fell from the previous month but was up strongly from a year ago. Growth was modest in Philadelphia. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and San Francisco reported higher hotel occupancy rates in at least some parts of their Districts. Boston noted that restaurant revenues increased relative to a year ago. Advance bookings for travel and lodging were strong in the Philadelphia, Richmond, and Minneapolis Districts. In the Atlanta District, hospitality contacts maintained a positive outlook for the remainder of 2014 and the beginning of 2015.       Nonfinancial Services        A number of Districts reported that activity in the nonfinancial services sector advanced since the previous Beige Book. The Boston District reported generally higher demand for consulting and advertising services. Philadelphia noted that over three-fourths of all service-sector contacts reported expectations that growth trends will remain positive over the next six months. Richmond reported that technology firms and engineering companies noted stronger revenue growth; Dallas indicated that demand for accounting services rose further from an already-high level; and Dallas and San Francisco noted that demand for legal services picked up in some areas. Staffing services increased in many Districts, including New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas. Philadelphia indicated that staffing requests increased for both temporary and permanent positions. A contact from a staffing firm in the Chicago District reported strong orders but noted that improving labor market conditions were leading to increased difficulties in finding qualified workers.              Districts reporting on transportation services generally noted growth since the previous report, with a few pointing to capacity constraints in railroads, trucking, or both. Atlanta reported increased railroad shipments and strong trucking freight demand. Contacts at trucking firms and railroads in the Cleveland District noted that insufficient capacity is a major issue that is currently confronting the industry. In the Minneapolis District, capacity constraints in freight rail have increased demand for trucking services and led to increased stockpiles at some iron ore production facilities. A trucking firm in the Kansas City District cited supply chain disruptions and new regulations as having slowed freight traffic. Dallas noted that air cargo volumes continued their upward trend, and Richmond indicated that activity remains strong at District ports. St. Louis reported some expansion plans for freight firms.       Manufacturing        Manufacturing activity increased in most Districts since the previous Beige Book. However, New York noted that manufacturing growth had stalled, and Boston indicated that their contacts cited weaker results than in the past few reports. The outlook for manufacturing was positive in a number of Districts.              Within manufacturing, growth was reported across a broad range of products. Cleveland, Chicago, and San Francisco noted increased steel demand. The Chicago and St. Louis Districts noted strength in the aerospace sector; however, San Francisco reported that aerospace and defense capacity utilization declined. Demand for construction materials or equipment increased in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis. Manufacturers reported continued demand from the energy sector in the Philadelphia and Cleveland Districts. Richmond and San Francisco noted strong demand for medical equipment. San Francisco reported that worldwide semiconductor sales were up markedly over the previous year. In contrast, a food producer in the Richmond District said that demand was flat; St. Louis and Minneapolis reported layoffs or plant closures by food producers; and Kansas City noted slower activity at some food processing plants. Chicago reported weaker demand for agricultural and mining equipment.       Real Estate and Construction        Reports on residential construction and real estate activity were mixed. New York noted that single-family construction was sluggish in some areas, but that multifamily construction increased. Philadelphia reported only slight growth in home construction. In August, single-family construction starts in the Cleveland District reached their highest level so far this year, though the number of starts year-to-date remained slightly lower than last year. Richmond noted that residential construction across the District increased slightly for custom homes. Atlanta reported that multifamily construction continued to increase across much of the District, while Chicago indicated that both single- and multi-family construction continued to expand. Residential real estate contacts in the Atlanta District indicated that existing home sales and prices remained ahead of last year's levels and inventory levels were down from a year ago. Chicago noted that home sales were somewhat lower, and growth in home prices and residential rents slowed. San Francisco reported that sales of single-family homes were stable since the previous report.              Commercial construction and real estate activity grew in most Districts. Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco reported increased commercial construction, industrial construction, or both. Cleveland noted that a majority of commercial contractors saw increased construction activity relative to a year ago. Commercial contractors in the Atlanta District saw an increase in construction activity across many property types. In Minneapolis, however, commercial construction activity declined. Richmond reported that commercial real estate activity improved modestly over the past several weeks. The New York District noted that the New York City office market continued to strengthen. Atlanta noted that many commercial brokers saw growth in activity. Chicago noted that commercial real estate activity continued to expand. Kansas City indicated that commercial vacancy rates declined and absorption and sales increased. Boston noted that commercial real estate fundamentals are either holding steady or improving.       Banking and Finance        In most Districts, banking conditions continued to improve relative to the previous Beige Book, with net increases in loan volumes reported in a number of Districts.              Since the previous Beige Book, New York reported that consumer loan demand had leveled off, Cleveland reported that consumer lending was stable, and Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City noted that consumer loan demand increased. Chicago reported strong growth in auto lending. New York reported decreased demand for loan refinancing, Philadelphia noted negligible demand for refinancing, and Richmond reported that refinancing demand was mostly unchanged, but down in some areas.              Demand for business credit expanded since the previous Beige Book. New York reported increased demand for commercial mortgages. Philadelphia noted increased loan volume for commercial and industrial loans. Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, and San Francisco noted increased commercial loan demand. Chicago noted that business demand for equipment and commercial real estate financing rose. Financing for mergers and acquisitions as well as for capital expenditures rose in the Dallas District. Kansas City noted slight increases in commercial and agricultural lending.              There were no reports of deterioration in credit quality. New York reported that delinquency rates continued to decline, particularly for commercial loans and mortgages. Philadelphia banking contacts described steady improvement in credit quality, and San Francisco noted that asset quality has improved since the previous report. Most bankers in the Kansas City District reported that loan quality was unchanged compared with a year ago.              Credit standards generally remained unchanged since the previous Beige Book. Cleveland noted that no changes were made to loan-application standards during the past six weeks, but lenders slightly relaxed terms and conditions. Some contacts in the Philadelphia District said that heated competition for loans was resulting in a slight rise in credit risks.       Agriculture and Natural Resources        Prices for many crops continued to decline since the previous Beige Book, driven in part by very strong realized or anticipated crop yields. This higher production is expected to offset some of the effect of lower prices on farm incomes. Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City reported very good crop conditions at the beginning of the harvest; additionally, Chicago and Minneapolis expect large corn and soybean harvests. Drought conditions persisted in parts of the Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas noted that livestock, poultry, and dairy producers had benefited from increased output prices and lower feed costs.              Since the previous Beige Book, oil exploration activity increased in the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Richmond and Minneapolis noted increases in natural gas production, and San Francisco reported increased natural gas and electricity sales to manufacturers. Compared with a year earlier, coal production was flat in Cleveland, mixed in Richmond, and increased in St. Louis. Recent decreases in oil prices were reported by Atlanta and Kansas City; natural gas price decreases were reported by Cleveland, Richmond, and Kansas City. Iron ore production in the Minneapolis District held steady since the previous report.       Employment, Wages, and Prices        The pace of employment growth was about the same as that reported in the previous Beige Book. Most Districts reported that some employers had difficulty finding qualified workers for certain positions. In particular, manufacturers in the Boston District said that they continue to look for machinists; Chicago noted that difficulties in finding skilled labor have often delayed construction projects; and in the Dallas District a shortage of workers in heavy construction and engineering was causing some delays in projects for the petrochemical industry. Contacts in Richmond, Minneapolis, and Kansas City noted difficulty in filling openings for truck drivers.              A number of Districts characterized wage growth as modest, though several also reported upward wage pressures for particular industries and occupations, such as skilled labor in construction and manufacturing. Cleveland, Richmond, and Kansas City noted upward wage pressures for transportation workers; Richmond also reported upward wage pressures for skilled engineers, managers, information technology professionals, and bankers. San Francisco noted that software developers were receiving above-average wage increases. New York reported that workers were more frequently leaving jobs for higher pay, while a contact in the St. Louis District noted increased turnover of skilled employees who were switching to higher-paying jobs.              Consistent with the previous Beige Book, overall price pressures remained subdued, with Districts reporting little to no change in price levels or modest increases. Firms generally reported that input prices were unchanged or up slightly. Districts noted that several commodity prices fell since the previous report, although cattle, hog, and dairy prices remained at elevated levels. New York reported that cost pressures have largely subsided among manufacturers, but remained fairly widespread among service firms. Firms in the Atlanta District indicated that their pricing power remained relatively weak. However, in Chicago, a number of manufacturers expected to be able to raise prices, especially in the auto industry. St. Louis reported that some retail dealers of construction materials increased prices. Minneapolis noted that metals prices decreased somewhat since the previous report. Restaurant menu prices in Kansas City rose more slowly than in previous surveys; San Francisco reported that restaurant prices increased slightly in July and August.",2014-10-15
102,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and based on information collected on or before November 24, 2014. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.          Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that national economic activity continued to expand in October and November. A number of Districts also noted that contacts remained optimistic about the outlook for future economic activity. Consumer spending continued to advance in most Districts, and reports on tourism were mostly positive. Employment gains were widespread across Districts, and Districts reporting on business spending generally noted some improvement. Demand for nonfinancial services generally increased. Manufacturing activity strengthened in most Districts. Construction and real estate activity expanded overall, but at a pace that varied by sector and by District. Lending typically held steady or increased. Crop yields were generally good, although overly wet or dry conditions were an issue in some Districts. Most crop prices were lower than last year, but livestock prices were higher. Energy and mining activity was higher on net, though lower oil prices were a concern for the oil industry in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts. Overall price and wage inflation remained subdued.           Consumer Spending and Tourism Consumer spending continued to trend higher in most Districts in October and November. Some contacts viewed lower gasoline prices as a contributing factor to higher consumer spending, and an early cold spell helped spur sales of winter apparel in several Districts. Both the Richmond and San Francisco Districts pointed to durable goods purchases as a source of strength. Restaurant sales were up in Cleveland and San Francisco but down in Kansas City. Retailers in many Districts were optimistic about the upcoming holiday season. Auto sales were particularly strong in Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco, and lower gasoline prices boosted sales of SUVs and light trucks in Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago.              Tourism reports were mostly positive for the reporting period. Early-winter weather conditions boosted activity in Richmond and Minneapolis as some ski resorts were able to open early. Richmond and San Francisco reported rising hotel occupancy rates and Philadelphia noted an increase in hotel revenues. Contacts in the Atlanta District noted an increase in the number of domestic and international visitors relative to last year and strong advance bookings for hotels and conferences for the first half of 2015. New York indicated that tourism was generally steady at a high level, with Broadway theater attendance and revenues moderately higher than a year ago. In contrast, tourism activity decreased further in the Kansas City District, but was expected to improve modestly in coming months.       Hiring and Business Spending Employment gains were widespread across Districts in October and November. Boston reported increased employment in the software and IT sectors, and New York noted that financial firms were hiring more workers. Cleveland indicated that manufacturing, construction, and freight transportation payrolls were increasing, and Richmond cited stronger hiring by service-sector firms. Atlanta reported sizable gains in leisure and hospitality employment. Several Districts noted an increase in temporary staffing as well as an increase in temporary-to-permanent job transitions. Hiring plans increased in New York, Chicago, and St. Louis. With labor market conditions strengthening, contacts in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts noted that firms were having increased difficulty retaining key workers. Various Districts continued to report that firms had difficulties filling positions in IT and engineering, legal and health-care services, management, skilled manufacturing and building trades, and transportation and warehousing. Most Districts reported little change in holiday-related hiring relative to last year, though there were some reports of slightly higher rates of seasonal hiring in New York and Chicago.              Districts reporting on business spending noted some improvement overall. Inventories were generally reported to be in line with sales. Richmond and Chicago noted some precautionary inventory building by retailers and manufacturers as insurance against another harsh winter. Reports on capital expenditures, both current and planned, were generally positive. Boston and Cleveland reported that retailers were investing in IT equipment and software to support e-commerce. Manufacturers in several Districts were expanding capital budgets both to replace existing equipment and to expand capacity. Freight companies in the Cleveland District were holding to plans to gradually replace an aging fleet and expand capacity. St. Louis and Minneapolis noted an increase in planned capital spending by service-sector firms. Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas cited an increase in mergers and acquisitions.       Nonfinancial Services Demand for nonfinancial services rose in a number of Districts in October and November. Several Districts reported broad-based growth in demand for staffing services. Growth in professional business services fell in Kansas City, but the Richmond District reported gains in accounting business and Dallas experienced expansions in legal and insurance services. Demand for technology services rose in the Boston, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts. San Francisco reported strong demand for cloud computing services. Growth in transportation services was uneven across Districts, but Cleveland continued to report strong demand, to the extent that shippers were running into capacity constraints. Various Districts reported increases in shipments of agricultural products, industrial machinery, oil and gas production materials, appliances, apparel, auto parts, e-commerce goods, and steel. Richmond reported increased port activity, especially for imports, but a decline in coal exports.       Manufacturing Manufacturing activity generally advanced during the reporting period. The automotive and aerospace industries continued to be sources of strength. Steel production increased in Cleveland, Chicago, and San Francisco. Fabricated metal manufacturers in the Chicago and Dallas Districts noted widespread growth in orders. Dallas reported that domestic sales for plastics were strong, while demand for plastics was steady in Richmond and declined in Kansas City. Chemical manufacturers in the Boston District indicated that the falling price of oil relative to natural gas had made U.S. producers less competitive, because foreign chemical producers rely more heavily on oil for feedstock and production. St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas reported that food production was little changed on balance, but production in Kansas City continued to decline. Chicago and Dallas indicated that shipments of construction materials increased. Manufacturers of heavy machinery in the Chicago District cited improvements in sales of construction machinery, but reported ongoing weak demand for agricultural and mining equipment. High-tech manufacturers in Boston, Dallas, and San Francisco noted steady growth in demand. Biotech revenue increased in the San Francisco District.       Construction and Real Estate Construction and real estate activity expanded overall in October and November, but saw a fair amount of variation across sectors and regions. Residential construction increased on balance across the Districts and multifamily construction remained stronger than single-family construction in a number of Districts. Reports on residential real estate activity were mixed. About half of the Districts reported an increase in home sales. Many Districts indicated that sales in the multifamily sector were stronger than sales in the single-family sector. Home prices were little changed in most Districts, although prices increased in the Richmond, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Nonresidential construction rose in most Districts. Construction of office space was relatively strong in some large urban areas, such as New York City and Philadelphia. Industrial construction was particularly strong in the Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas Districts. Commercial real estate activity also increased in many Districts, with declining vacancies and rising rents for office space; especially strong activity was noted in the central business districts of some large urban areas. Vacancies for commercial and industrial space also dropped in several Districts.       Banking and Finance Lending activity improved on net. A few Districts noted aggressive competition on loan pricing and terms or an easing of loan standards. Business lending increased for most types of loans. Boston, New York, and Richmond cited an increase in demand for commercial mortgages, and commercial and industrial lending increased in Philadelphia and St. Louis. San Francisco reported an increase in demand for small business refinance loans and noted private financing activity and venture capital activity were both strong. Chicago also cited stronger loan demand from small businesses for financing equipment and structures. Dallas indicated that real estate lending increased, with strength reported in loans for both single-family and multifamily construction projects. In contrast, Kansas City reported lower demand for agricultural loans, and Chicago noted lower utilization of credit lines for working capital. Consumer lending also increased. Several Districts reported continued strength in demand for auto loans. Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco noted an increase in credit card lending. Residential lending increased in a number of Districts, reflecting a mix of new mortgages, refinancings, and home equity lines of credit. Cleveland and Richmond indicated that first-time homebuyers continued to face challenges in qualifying for mortgages, although contacts in Boston were optimistic that the new Qualified Residential Mortgage rule would be helpful in this regard.       Agriculture and Natural Resources Agricultural conditions were mixed across the Districts. Livestock operations were more profitable than a year ago; but with crop yields generally at above-average to record-high levels, lower crop prices were depressing farm incomes. Harvests were ahead of their normal pace in most Districts reporting on agriculture. However, excess moisture delayed harvests in some Districts, affected the quality of cotton in the Dallas District, and damaged wheat and barley crops in the San Francisco District. In contrast, drought conditions affected the Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts, as well as parts of the Dallas District. Dry weather delayed tree harvests in Richmond, even as Christmas orders picked up. Compared with a year ago, prices were lower for corn, soybeans, wheat, and hay, but higher for milk, dairy, poultry, hogs, cattle, and tomatoes. Livestock producers benefited from lower feed costs, and Chicago and Kansas City noted expansions in cattle herds. Richmond and San Francisco reported increased exports of agricultural products, but Dallas reported lower dairy exports.              Natural resource activity was strong overall. Oil and natural gas exploration, drilling, and extraction remained at high levels in the Cleveland, Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts, with expansions in drilling activity in Kansas City and Dallas. Atlanta reported that the recent drop in oil prices led firms to reevaluate their operations, though steady production is anticipated for both deepwater and onshore drilling; in the Dallas District, lower oil prices weighed on the outlook for drilling activity. Natural gas prices decreased slightly as inventories grew. Coal production in the Cleveland and St. Louis Districts was up from a year ago. Since the previous report, mining activity increased in the Minneapolis District. Healthy demand for timber was noted by San Francisco, leading to increased shortages of equipment and skilled loggers.       Prices and Wages Overall price and wage inflation remained subdued in October and November. Price increases for raw materials were generally muted, though there were some exceptions, such as prices for certain agricultural products and building materials. Several Districts cited the decline in the price of oil over the reporting period and its effects on gasoline and diesel fuel prices. However, transportation costs rose in some Districts where capacity constraints were an issue. Chicago and San Francisco reported lower steel prices, but Dallas noted an increase in fabricated metals prices. Pass-through of higher costs to downstream prices remained limited, although Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas reported an uptick in the number of firms raising or expecting to raise prices. New York and Cleveland noted an increase among retailers in holiday promotional activity relative to last year, and Philadelphia indicated that retailers would be using promotions to extend the shorter-than-usual holiday shopping season.              A number of Districts reported slight to moderate increases in labor costs during the reporting period. Upward wage pressures continued to be evident for certain types of occupations and for skilled workers. New York, Chicago, and San Francisco reported that employers were adjusting compensation to win well-qualified job candidates or to retain or give raises to high-value, long-term existing employees. In addition, Atlanta noted nascent signs of wage pressures for lower-skilled jobs, whose wages have been flat for several years. Minimum wage increases were said to be a source of higher labor costs in the Boston, Cleveland, and San Francisco Districts. Boston, Chicago, and Dallas noted actual or prospective increases in health insurance costs; in contrast, San Francisco indicated that increases in health insurance premiums for the coming year were low by historical standards. Some of the higher costs associated with health care were reportedly being passed on to employees.",2014-12-03
103,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and based on information collected on or before January 5, 2015.  This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.          Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that national economic activity continued to expand during the reporting period of mid-November through late December, with most Districts reporting a ""modest"" or ""moderate"" pace of growth. In contrast, the Kansas City District reported only slight growth in December. However, most of their contacts, along with those of several other Districts, expect somewhat faster growth over the coming months. The Dallas District indicated that growth slowed slightly during the reporting period and that several contacts expressed concern about the effect of lower oil prices on the District economy. Consumer spending increased in most Districts, with generally modest year-over-year gains in retail sales. Auto sales showed moderate to strong growth. Travel and tourism picked up during the reporting period. The pace of growth of demand for nonfinancial services varied widely across Districts and across sectors, but appeared to be moderate on balance. Manufacturing activity expanded in most Districts. Single-family residential real estate sales and construction were largely flat on balance across the Districts, while commercial real estate activity expanded. Demand for business and consumer credit grew. Credit quality improved a bit further overall. Agricultural conditions were mixed. Overall demand for energy-related products and services weakened somewhat, while the output of energy-related products increased.                  Payrolls in a variety of sectors expanded moderately during the reporting period. Significant wage pressures were largely limited to workers with specialized technical skills. Prices increased slightly, on balance, in most Districts.       Consumer Spending and Tourism        Consumer spending increased in most Districts, with generally modest year-over-year gains in retail sales. Contacts reported slight to modest gains in the Boston, Dallas, Philadelphia, and Cleveland Districts. Sales were solid in Atlanta. Moderate holiday sales growth exceeded expectations in Chicago and met expectations in San Francisco. General merchandise retailers in the New York District indicated that sales were largely sluggish and below plan for the holiday season. The Kansas City District reported that retail sales were lower than a year earlier, with a few retailer contacts noting a drop in sales of high-end products. In contrast, Philadelphia and San Francisco reported that high-end merchandise continued to sell well.              Auto sales showed moderate to strong growth on a year-over-year basis, with Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Dallas at the lower end of this range, and Atlanta and Chicago at the higher end. Atlanta auto dealers noted that lower gas prices quickly boosted purchases of larger vehicles. However, some dealers in the St. Louis District reported excess inventories of luxury cars.

The Boston, New York, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts reported strong travel and tourism activity. Broadway theaters reported that attendance and revenues were up more than 10 percent from the same period in 2013. Tourism in the Richmond and Kansas City Districts was at or above normal seasonal levels. However, ski resorts in the Philadelphia District struggled to attract visitors in the midst of unseasonably warm weather. Warm December weather in the Minneapolis District also reduced winter tourism there.       Nonfinancial Services        The pace of demand growth for nonfinancial services varied widely across Districts and sectors during the reporting period, but appeared to be moderate on balance. Overall, nonfinancial service-sector firms in the Philadelphia and San Francisco Districts continued to report moderate growth.

Contacts at factories in the Cleveland District reported that demand increased a bit on balance. Manufacturing activity grew at a moderate pace in Boston, New York, Chicago, and San Francisco. However, a manufacturer in the Boston District indicated that congestion at West Coast ports had impeded its exports.

Minneapolis and Kansas City reported that manufacturing activity increased only slightly during the reporting period.       Real Estate and Construction        Single-family residential real estate sales and construction were largely flat on balance across the Districts. Sales declined somewhat on a year-over-year basis in the Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. In the Philadelphia District, year-over-year existing home sales finished lower in November, but pending December sales in some areas were up notably over December 2013. However, builders of new homes in the Philadelphia District reported weak traffic for prospective buyers and fewer contract signings. San Francisco reported that overall home sales picked up in December. Richmond reported a modest increase in housing market activity. Home prices increased modestly, on balance, in the Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas Districts.

Demand for auto loans in the Chicago District grew moderately, and one contact noted a significant spike in credit card applications.              Credit quality generally remained good, with overall reductions in loan delinquencies. According to the Philadelphia District, most of their financial industry contacts reported continued improvements in their customers' overall credit quality and in their own loan portfolios. However, high rates of severely distressed mortgages persisted in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Contacts reported little change in their own lending standards. However, several Districts commented that their contacts indicated that stiff competition for high-quality borrowers was leading to lower underwriting standards among lenders more generally.       Agriculture and Natural Resources        Agricultural conditions were mixed during the reporting period. Contacts in the Richmond District reported that agribusiness conditions were better than in the same period a year earlier. The St. Louis District reported that winter wheat harvests are likely to be lower than average, largely reflecting planting delays in Illinois due to wet weather in October. The level of red meat output in the St. Louis District through November was below year-earlier levels, while hog and milk output in the Chicago District was higher than expected during the reporting period. Agricultural lenders in the Minneapolis District expected farm incomes in the fourth quarter of 2014 to come in below the level of the same quarter in 2013. Prices received by farmers in the Minneapolis District in December decreased from the previous year for corn, soybeans, wheat, hay, and milk; prices increased for cattle, hogs, eggs, and poultry. Agricultural growing conditions in the Kansas City District were generally favorable in December, and crop prices rose modestly. Kansas City reported that wheat prices increased modestly amid global supply concerns about limits on Russian grain exports and lower production estimates in Australia. The Dallas District reported that agricultural conditions improved slightly, but drought conditions continued in portions of Texas. Some areas of the Atlanta District saw a moderate improvement in drought conditions. Dairy farm profits in the San Francisco District increased significantly over the past year, but milk futures prices declined recently. Uncertainty regarding future water availability in California slowed new plantings of permanent crops.              Overall demand for energy-related products and services weakened somewhat during the reporting period. The Kansas City and Dallas Districts reported that demand for oilfield services decreased, while the Atlanta District reported that growth in the supply of crude oil and natural gas continued to outpace demand growth. However, contacts in the San Francisco District reported that energy demand from manufacturers was solid. The overall output of energy-related products increased. Natural gas production in the Richmond District increased moderately during the reporting period, and the number of natural gas rigs in the Kansas City District increased. The pace of coal production in the St. Louis District during the reporting period exceeded that of the same period in 2013, and year-to-date coal production in the Cleveland District slightly exceeded prior year levels. The rate of coal production in the Richmond District remained slow during the reporting period. The Cleveland District reported that natural gas extraction activity remained at a high level. Oil drilling activity in the Kansas City District declined, and contacts expect that District's energy sector to slow further in response to lower energy prices.       Employment, Wages, and Prices        Payrolls in a variety of sectors expanded moderately during the reporting period. The Chicago District reported that overall hiring increased, and the Minneapolis District indicated that labor markets continued to tighten. Contacts at staffing firms in the Philadelphia District reported continued moderate increases in hiring for both temporary and permanent positions. Labor demand in the Richmond District increased, and the Atlanta District saw job gains across most sectors. Payrolls increased at a modest pace in the Cleveland District, primarily in banking, freight services, and manufacturing. Manufacturing payrolls also expanded in the Richmond and St. Louis Districts.

Reports of hiring in the Dallas District were slightly less widespread than in the previous reporting period, and a few energy firms in that District reported hiring freezes and layoffs.              Significant wage pressures continued to be limited largely to workers with particular technical skills. Indeed, the Philadelphia, Cleveland and Chicago Districts noted that upward wage pressures tended to be limited to experienced and technically-skilled personnel. The Richmond District reported that overall wage pressures were mild during the reporting period and that average wage growth in manufacturing slowed somewhat. The Dallas District noted fewer reports of rising wage pressures than in the previous reporting period. In contrast, Kansas City reported that wage growth accelerated slightly, with many contacts citing labor shortages.              Prices increased slightly, on balance, in most Districts during the reporting period. Overall prices in the Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas Districts were largely stable. Businesses in the Atlanta District continued to report little input cost pressure and limited pricing power.

Contacts in Cleveland and Richmond indicated that shipping volume has remained strong since the previous report. Contacts in Atlanta noted that disruptions at West Coast ports may be contributing to the increase in shipping volume. Drilling service firms in Minneapolis reported reduced demand due to lower oil prices, and oilfield services contacts in Dallas noted a sharp decline in demand.       Real Estate and Construction        Residential real estate conditions were mixed across the Districts. Home sales and prices increased in most Districts; construction activity was mixed, with some Districts reporting disruptions due to severe weather. Residential sales increased in Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco. Sales fell in Cleveland and Kansas City. Contacts in New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland partially attributed lower construction to inclement weather conditions. Contacts in Boston noted low levels of inventory due, in part, to inclement weather. Reports noted that low levels of inventory and lack of desirable lots continue to slow the market: Contacts in Boston, Cleveland, Kansas City, and San Francisco cited a lack of available inventory, while contacts in Cleveland and Richmond noted a lack of available lots.

Reports across the Districts indicated that credit quality has remained largely unchanged or has improved since the prior reporting period. Bankers in most Districts reported no change in their own lending standards.  However, several bankers in the Richmond and St. Louis Districts reported relaxed standards.  Bankers in the Philadelphia, Richmond, and San Francisco Districts noted that competition is lowering lending standards more generally.       Agriculture and Natural Resources        Agricultural conditions worsened since the previous report across the Districts due to weak farm income, persistent drought, and declining exports. Prices for corn and soybeans fell over the reporting period in the Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. A majority of contacts in the Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts noted that farm incomes had fallen from year-earlier levels. Kansas City noted that farmland values had leveled off after recent gains while ranchland values continued to rise due to strong demand. Input prices for the upcoming spring planting season were reported as stable in the Richmond and Chicago Districts. Contacts in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts noted that a stronger dollar was hurting agricultural exports. Furthermore, the Chicago and San Francisco Districts noted that labor disputes at ports along the West Coast have also had a negative impact on exports. Drought conditions improved but still persisted in some areas of the Atlanta and Dallas Districts, while drought conditions in the San Francisco District hurt yields and didn't show immediate signs of improvement.              Oil and natural gas drilling declined in the Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. In contrast, the Richmond District reported that natural gas production was unchanged.

Coal production was unchanged in both the Cleveland and Richmond Districts, while it increased modestly in the St. Louis District. Both the Cleveland and Richmond Districts reported lower coal prices.       Employment, Wages, and Prices        Employment levels remained stable or continued to grow in most Districts and across a variety of sectors. Contacts in several Districts noted strong labor demand and challenges filling a variety of skilled positions. Firms in the Philadelphia District reported positive employment trends in a broad range of sectors, with the majority of hires due to economic growth rather than replacement. Businesses in the New York District continued to increase employment. Contacts in the Boston and Cleveland Districts reported little change in hiring. The Cleveland, Atlanta, Richmond, and Dallas Districts reported increased hiring in manufacturing. In contrast, contacts in the gas and oil production and related industries in the Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts reported downsizing or layoffs.              Wage pressures were moderate across most Districts, but some contacts reported increased wages to attract skilled workers for difficult-to-fill positions. In particular, service sector firms in the New York District noted increasingly widespread reports of wage hikes. Contacts in the Cleveland, Richmond, and Kansas City Districts noted increased wage pressure due to the difficulty in attracting and retaining truck drivers. A staffing firm in the Chicago District reported some companies were also willing to raise rates for unskilled workers to reduce turnover, and contacts in the Atlanta District noted increasing entry-level wages.              Most Districts reported flat to slight increases in overall prices. Contacts in the Cleveland and San Francisco Districts noted lower fuel surcharges, but contacts in the Atlanta and San Francisco Districts also remarked that the decline in energy prices was seen mainly as an opportunity for businesses to improve margins.

105,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland based on information collected on or before April 3, 2015. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.          Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that the economy continued to expand across most regions from mid-February through the end of March. Activity in the Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts grew at a moderate pace, while New York, Philadelphia, and St. Louis cited modest growth. Boston reported that business activity continues to expand, while Cleveland cited a slight pace of growth. Atlanta and Kansas City described economic conditions as steady.                  Demand for manufactured products was mixed during the current reporting period. Weakening activity was attributed in part to the strong dollar, falling oil prices, and the harsh winter weather. Business service firms saw rising activity, especially for high-tech services, and they expect positive near-term growth. Cargo diversions resulting from labor disputes on the West Coast boosted activity at several East Coast ports. A majority of Districts reported higher retail sales, and they cited consumer savings from lower energy prices as helping boost transactions. Auto sales rose in most Districts. Tourism and business travel is rebounding from the harsh winter, with contacts expecting growth for the remainder of the year in corporate and leisure travel. Residential real estate activity was steady to improving across most Districts, although there was some slowing in housing starts due to abnormal seasonal patterns owing to the harsh weather. Multifamily construction remains strong. Activity in nonresidential real estate was stable or improved slightly across many Districts. Agricultural conditions worsened slightly. Factors contributing to these conditions varied by District, but included wet fields, persistent drought, and a harsh winter. Investment in oil and gas drilling declined, while mining activity was mixed. Banking conditions were largely stable, with some improvement seen in loan demand.              Labor markets remained stable or continued to improve modestly. Layoffs related to the decline in oil and gas prices were reported in multiple Districts. Difficulty finding skilled workers was frequently reported. Districts noted modest upward pressure on wages and overall prices.       Manufacturing        Demand for manufactured products was mixed during the current reporting period. Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco reported an increase on net, while some weakening was observed in New York, Richmond, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Gains in activity among aerospace firms were reported in the Cleveland, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts. Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Kansas City noted weakening in the primary and fabricated metal products industry, while their counterparts in Dallas reported growth. A slowing in the chemicals industry was observed in St. Louis and Kansas City, while chemical producers in Dallas cited lower prices and margins, and lower exports, which they attributed to the strong dollar. Weakness in the steel industry was seen in Cleveland, Chicago, and San Francisco. The auto industry remained a source of strength in Cleveland and Chicago. Contacts in Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, and Dallas believe harsh winter weather had a dampening effect on activity. Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas attributed some weakening in demand to a strong dollar, which increased the risk to international sales. One firm in Boston noted that the changing value of the dollar increases incentives to minimize inventories. Falling oil prices had a negative impact on new orders to energy supplier companies in Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Some firms in Cleveland and Philadelphia noted heightened uncertainty due to anticipated weak demand from customers serving the energy sector. However, an oilfield machinery manufacturer in Dallas expects that the energy industry will begin showing signs of improvement in the second quarter. Capital spending plans were little changed in Boston and Cleveland, but they declined in Philadelphia and Kansas City. Richmond and Atlanta reported a slight increase in inventories, whereas Boston reported no significant changes. The overall outlook by contacts in Boston, Philadelphia, and Dallas is positive. However, in Cleveland and Atlanta, optimism regarding the outlook has waned slightly during the last six weeks. In Kansas City, producers' expectations for future activity moderated somewhat but remain slightly positive.       Nonfinancial Services        Nonfinancial services firms saw rising activity across all reporting Districts. A pickup in demand for high-tech services such as cyber security and web development was reported by contacts in Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Healthcare-related services are experiencing accelerating growth in Boston and Richmond. Dallas law firms noted more work in mergers and acquisitions, bankruptcies, and litigation. Sales were strong for accounting services in Richmond and Dallas. A rise in demand for architectural services was seen in Minneapolis and San Francisco. In Boston, government agencies started awarding more contracts to private-sector consulting firms, albeit with less assured funding. Service providers in Boston, Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas have an optimistic outlook and expect positive near-term growth trends for their firms.              Demand for transportation and freight services was mixed. Freight haulers in Cleveland reported that volume has declined from the high levels seen late last year. They attributed it to harsh winter weather and fallout from the labor dispute at California ports, which lessened shipments to the District. District port officials in Richmond noted stronger volumes over the reporting period. Diversions from the West Coast added to the volume. Coal exports continued to decline, while auto exports and imports remained strong. Reports on transportation activity in Atlanta were mixed. Contacts at East Coast ports cited significant upticks in cargo volumes as shipments were redirected from the West Coast due to labor disputes. Railroad cargo traffic, however, was described as flat to only slightly up compared with year-ago levels. The majority of Atlanta's logistic contacts anticipate higher growth for the year. In Dallas, sea, air, and courier cargo volumes were up over the reporting period, while rail cargo volumes were down. Air cargo contacts noted that volume growth in the international market outpaced that in the domestic market.       Consumer Spending and Tourism        The Boston, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts reported higher retail sales. New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas reported that retail sales were mixed to slightly down, with colder-than-normal temperatures being mentioned as one possible cause. Cleveland noted that retail sales were flat year-over-year. Among retailers, the outlook was generally optimistic in Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, St Louis, Kanas City, and Dallas. Many Districts noted that savings from lower energy prices are helping to drive retail sales this cycle, as is the improving weather situation. Dallas retailers expressed some caution about the strength of the U.S. dollar, while New York noted that some retailers saw a falloff in Canadian shoppers due to the strong dollar. It was reported that consumer confidence in the New York District, albeit slightly lower, remains near its multi-year high, set in January.              Auto sales rose in most Districts during the cycle period. Reports from Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago indicated that lower gasoline prices were causing consumers to shift from cars to light trucks or SUVs. New York and Philadelphia reported that sales had bounced back in March from the harsh winter weather in February. However, in Kanas City, auto sales slowed in March and were flat compared to last year. Dallas continues to see auto sales increase, but may see slowing demand growth later in the year, depending on the effect of the energy-industry slowdown and interest rate movements.              Tourism and travel started to rebound from the harsh weather seen in the winter months. Boston and New York reported tourism below levels seen a year ago. Boston noted that there are still ripple effects through many industries that are related to the bad weather this past winter, while Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City reported positive and growing activity in their Districts. A few Districts noted that business travel and convention-center bookings are up. Atlanta mentioned that lower gasoline prices are a contributing factor to the rise in visitors driving to destinations. Minneapolis reported tourism activity as flat for the cycle; warm weather and the lack of snow brought an early end to winter tourism for several areas in this District. But summer bookings for hotels are up compared to last year. New York tourism activity has slowed somewhat in recent weeks. Theaters are experiencing weaker revenues, and occupancy rates and room rates in New York City are down from a year ago. All reporting Districts noted that corporate and leisure travel are expected to be up in 2015.       Real Estate and Construction        Residential real estate activity improved in the Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, while remaining steady in all others, except New York, which reported softening conditions. Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Dallas reported a slowdown in construction activity due in part to harsh weather conditions. Low-to-declining levels of inventory were cited by contacts in Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco. The Chicago District reported that inventories were near historic lows, particularly for lower-priced homes. Most Districts reported a tight supply of residential real estate in most price points of the market. The Philadelphia and Cleveland Districts reported that mid- to high-priced homes were selling better, while Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas reported that low- to mid-ranged homes were outpacing other categories in sales. Cleveland and Philadelphia reported an absence of first-time homebuyers. Contacts across the system uniformly reported that they were optimistic and many expect a greater than normal upswing in home sales with the coming of spring. The multifamily sector remains strong, with flat to declining vacancy rates reported in multiple Districts. Boston, Cleveland, and San Francisco reported a continued shortage of skilled labor, which was cited as a factor driving up wages.              Commercial real estate activity remained stable to expanding across many Districts. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco all saw strong gains in industrial and office building construction. Demand for commercial properties in the city of Boston continues to be fuelled by foreign institutional investors, many of which are increasing their allocations to real estate. Contacts in Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas noted stable to strong multifamily construction. Chicago reported that leasing of industrial buildings, office and retail space all increased. Cleveland mentioned that successful developers have easier access to credit compared to prior years, and Boston reported a slight uptick in speculative activity for commercial construction.       Banking and Finance        Banking conditions remain positive across reporting Districts. On balance, demand for credit increased at a slight to moderate rate in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Commercial real estate loan demand was strong in Atlanta and Dallas, while contacts in Philadelphia and Kansas City described CRE lending as stable. Demand for commercial and industrial loans grew slightly in St. Louis and Kansas City, while exhibiting stronger growth in New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago. Bankers in Atlanta reported that C&I lending in areas linked to the energy industry slowed as a result of oil-price declines. In San Francisco, some banks are building a sizeable pipeline of pending loans and have increased interest rates a bit in order to bring demand more in line with supply. Consumer lending grew in New York, Atlanta, and Chicago but was soft in Cleveland and San Francisco. Auto lending remained strong in Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco. One contact in Cleveland attributed weakened bank-financed auto lending to captive-finance operations that are becoming very aggressive. Residential mortgage demand--particularly for refinancings--grew in Richmond, Chicago and Dallas and was steady in New York. Home equity line volumes fell in Philadelphia and Cleveland. Bankers in the Philadelphia and Kansas City Districts expressed confidence in the quality of their loan portfolios, while New York and Cleveland noted that delinquencies were down or remained at low levels. Richmond reported that there was some loosening of credit standards, with one lender expressing concern that credit quality was declining as a result.       Agriculture and Natural Resources        Agricultural conditions worsened slightly across reporting Districts since the previous cycle due to a variety of conditions including wet fields, persistent drought, and a cold winter. Prices for corn and soybeans fell over the reporting period in the Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts. Chicago and St. Louis reported that less corn will be planted this year, being replaced by soybeans. Contacts in the Kansas City District noted that feeder cattle prices have improved. Contacts in Minneapolis reported turkey producers were concerned about an outbreak of an extremely virulent strain of flu that has killed thousands of birds. Input prices for the upcoming spring planting season were reported as increasing in Chicago. Drought conditions improved but still persisted in some areas of the Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, while wet field conditions slowed planting in parts of Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas. Falling pork prices were attributed to declining export demand, resulting in higher domestic supplies. Contacts in Chicago noted that beef prices remain elevated, but off their highs, due to cattle herds being rebuilt.              Reports indicated that energy market conditions declined in the Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. The number of active drilling rigs fell in Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas. Active drilling rigs in North Dakota and Montana reached their lowest levels in five years. However, despite the decline in permits and new investment, overall production in the oil and gas sector remains strong to increasing. Oil and gas producers in the Cleveland, Atlanta, and Dallas Districts anticipate cuts in 2015 capital expenditures. Layoffs were reported in the Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts. Coal production declined year-over-year in the Richmond and St. Louis Districts but was mostly unchanged in Cleveland. Coal prices were reported as unchanged in the Richmond District, but declined in Cleveland. While producers are optimistic about continued production growth in oil and gas, layoffs are occurring in the industry as well as in coal.       Employment, Wages, and Prices        In most Districts, labor market conditions remained stable or continued to show modest improvement. Increases in hiring or employment levels were reported in the New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas Districts. In Boston, only stronger-performing firms have made significant increases to employment levels, while payrolls in Cleveland remained generally stable. Several layoffs were announced by contacts in Minneapolis, and so changes to labor markets were described as mixed. Layoffs in the manufacturing and energy sectors were reported in multiple Districts including Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas. These reductions were primarily related to the decline in gas and oil prices and the resultant decline in upstream demand such as iron ore mining and steel manufacturing. In Chicago, skilled workers continue to be in high demand. Firms in many Districts, including Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas, reported having difficulty finding skilled workers, especially in professional and business services and the IT sectors. The Richmond, Atlanta, and St. Louis Districts specifically noted an increasing incidence of voluntary turnover of employees.              Modest or moderate wage pressures were reported in several Districts including New York, Richmond, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Wage pressures in Atlanta were muted. Wage pressures in Cleveland and Chicago were more pronounced for skilled workers. However, Chicago noted that there were more reports of wage increases for unskilled workers than in the previous reporting period. Contacts in San Francisco noted some seepage of wage pressures that had been limited to higher-end jobs in urban areas into middle-tier jobs and smaller towns. In the Minneapolis District, the strong wage increases observed in the energy-producing region over the past few years have slowed, and in some cases, declined. Retail sector wages in Kansas City experienced a mild decline but are expected to grow in the coming months.              Districts generally reported stable or modestly increasing overall price levels. Prices remained generally steady in the New York, Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts; while prices in Philadelphia, Richmond, Kansas City, and San Francisco increased slightly. In the Chicago District, input-price declines have been putting downward pressure on manufacturing prices, while retail prices have remained mostly unchanged. Aside from on-going energy-price increases associated with limited natural gas capacity in the region and the effects of the strong dollar, non-labor costs and prices in Boston remain steady. Retailers in Dallas noted increased transportation costs due to the West Coast port strike, while firms in several Districts mentioned lower transportation costs due to lower energy prices.",2015-04-15
106,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas based on information collected on or before May 22, 2015. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.          Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest overall economic activity expanded during the reporting period from early April to late May. Activity in the Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts was characterized as growing at a moderate pace, while the New York, Philadelphia, and St. Louis Districts cited modest growth. Contacts in the Boston District reported mixed conditions, and the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts indicated a slight pace of expansion. Compared to the previous report, the pace of growth slowed slightly in the Dallas District but held steady in the Atlanta District. Outlooks among respondents were generally optimistic, with growth expected to continue at a modest to moderate pace in several districts.                  Manufacturing activity generally held steady or increased over the reporting period, except for in the Dallas District where it was slightly weaker and in the Kansas City District where it fell markedly. Strength was seen in transportation equipment manufacturing, while continued weakness was reported in primary and fabricated metals products and energy-related industries. Most districts reported an uptick in retail spending, and outlooks were positive, with retailers expecting continued sales growth in 2015. Overall vehicle sales rose, particularly for trucks and SUVs which auto dealers in some districts attributed to lower gasoline prices. Travel and tourism expanded across most reporting districts, except for the New York and Kansas City Districts.              Demand for nonfinancial services increased, and staffing firms reported steady or higher activity. Port activity was strong in the Richmond, Atlanta, and Dallas Districts, but reports on other freight and transportation services activity were mixed. Most districts said residential and commercial real estate activity and construction improved since the last report. Home prices continued rising and low home inventories continued to constrain sales activity in some areas of the country. Overall loan demand increased, with particular strength noted in the New York District. Credit quality and delinquency rates were stable or improved. Credit standards were mostly unchanged, except for scattered reports of easing in the Philadelphia, St. Louis, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts.              The agricultural sector improved as significant rainfall alleviated the dry spell or improved growing conditions in several districts. However, drought conditions persisted in the San Francisco District and the outbreak of the avian flu severely impacted poultry producers in the Chicago and Minneapolis Districts. Oil and natural gas activity continued to decline in most districts, except for Cleveland where the rig count leveled off. Coal production was flat to down.              Employment levels were up slightly over the reporting period, with some reports of layoffs. Wages rose slightly. Prices were stable or ticked up, although manufacturers in some districts cited lower input prices.       Manufacturing        Manufacturing was mostly flat to up over the reporting period, except for in the Dallas District where it was steady to slightly weaker and in the Kansas City District where it declined sharply. Growth was moderate in the Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts. The Philadelphia District reported slight growth, while factory activity was mostly flat in the New York, Cleveland, Richmond, San Francisco, and Minneapolis Districts.              Growth rates varied across industries. Demand for transportation equipment manufacturing was strong in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts, and machinery manufacturers reported solid gains in the Philadelphia District and were expanding operations in the St. Louis District. Demand for high-tech products softened in the Dallas District, but sales of semi-conductors picked up in the San Francisco District. Manufacturers of construction materials and/or machinery continued to see strengthening demand in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts, but unusually wet weather caused demand to flatten in the Dallas District. Demand increased for rubber and plastics products in the Philadelphia and Richmond Districts, and contacts in the biotech and pharmaceutical industries in the San Francisco District reported strong growth and record levels of activity in mergers and acquisitions. Reports of weaker activity for primary and/or fabricated metals manufacturing came from the Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Reports on the steel industry were mixed; the Cleveland and San Francisco Districts reported some continued weakness, in part due to a strong dollar, while some contacts in the Richmond and Chicago Districts said steel shipments and/or capacity utilization picked up over the reporting period. The impact of the strong dollar was felt in other industries as well, with the Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas District noting its negative impact on export sales or capital investment in segments with significant overseas exposure.              The downturn in the oil and gas industry tempered manufacturing growth in over half the districts, particularly for industries dependent on the energy sector. These districts were Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City and Dallas. The Kansas City District reported that manufacturing production fell most sharply in the district's energy-producing states like Oklahoma and New Mexico. The Dallas District noted that oilfield machinery sales remained weak and were down significantly from a year ago, and the Philadelphia District said businesses involved in natural gas and pipeline work noted negative impacts from decreased drilling activity and lowered capital expenditures. Contacts in the Boston District said the slowdown in oil and gas investment has been much bigger and faster than anticipated.              Cleveland and San Francisco District contacts generally increased their capital spending budgets over the reporting period, while contacts in the Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts noted declines and Boston and Philadelphia District contacts said capital expenditures were steady. Overall outlooks among manufacturers were generally positive, with some exceptions in the Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts.       Consumer Spending and Tourism        Consumer spending increased across the districts since the prior report, except in the Richmond District, where retail sales were unchanged, and in the New York District, where retail sales fell slightly. Retailers in the New York District and mall retailers in the Philadelphia District said April sales were down year over year and attributed some of the weakness to the Easter holiday falling earlier this year. The Boston, Cleveland, and Kansas City Districts observed stronger sales on a year-over-year basis. A few districts noted weak demand for apparel, including Boston, Philadelphia and Chicago. The Chicago and San Francisco Districts reported strong sales in the entertainment and gaming sector. Contacts in the Cleveland and San Francisco Districts said low gasoline prices provided a tailwind for consumer spending, while contacts in the Atlanta District said this had yet to materialize. Inventory levels were mostly reported as satisfactory. A contact in the New York District said delays at West Coast ports have subsided while contacts in the Cleveland, Atlanta, and Dallas Districts said they were still being negatively impacted by residual effects of the strike. Outlooks among retailers were mostly positive, expecting continued growth throughout 2015.              Auto sales were up across the districts, except for in New York where they were flat on net and in Cleveland where they declined slightly. Sales growth was strongest in the Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts. Lower gasoline prices continued to spur a shift from cars to light trucks or SUVs in the Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts, and auto dealers in the St. Louis and San Francisco Districts also noted stronger growth in trucks and SUVs relative to other models. A Philadelphia District contact said auto dealers were in a slower growth mode as a result of strong sales in 2014, and noted that current sales volumes were approaching record highs. Auto inventories rose in the Kansas City and Richmond Districts, and in the Chicago District inventories were elevated for car dealerships due to increased demand for SUVs and trucks. Outlooks were generally optimistic for further auto sales growth in 2015.              Tourism and travel improved in several districts but showed signs of continued slowing in the New York District and moved down in Kansas City. Hotel occupancy was up in the Boston, Richmond, and San Francisco Districts, and was strong in the Atlanta District. In the New York District, Manhattan hotels and Broadway theatres reported lower revenues. Restaurant sales increased in the Boston, Philadelphia, and San Francisco Districts but remained weak in the Kansas City District, although contacts there anticipate growth in coming months. Strong summer hotel and resort bookings were noted in the Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and Minneapolis Districts.       Nonfinancial Services        Demand for nonfinancial services, such as information technology, healthcare, and professional and business services generally expanded since the previous report. The Kansas City and San Francisco Districts noted moderate growth in demand for information technology services, while mixed business conditions were reported by software and IT services contacts in the Boston District. Revenues at engineering and architectural services firms increased, according to Richmond's report. Activity in healthcare services was strong according to reports from the Richmond and San Francisco Districts, and a few San Francisco District contacts noted that the Affordable Care Act was a source of continued growth. The Richmond and Dallas Districts noted continued strength in accounting services. The Dallas District report cited mixed demand for legal services, while activity at legal firms in the San Francisco District remained weak and contacts said that many new graduates were underemployed or working in other fields. Service providers in the Boston, Philadelphia, and Dallas Districts have an optimistic outlook and professional and high-tech services contacts in the Kansas City District reported solid capital spending plans.              Staffing services demand generally grew at a stable or improved pace since the prior report. Demand for staffing services ticked up in the Cleveland and Dallas Districts, and grew at steady pace in the Philadelphia and Chicago Districts. A recruiting firm in the Minneapolis District said demand expanded at a faster clip compared with the past few years, and a staffing contact in the Richmond District said employers were making hiring decisions more quickly. In contrast, an employment agency in the New York District said hiring activity slowed slightly from the brisk pace seen in March, and reports from staffing agencies in the Boston District were mixed, ranging from strong growth in demand to continued weakness.              Reports on transportation services and freight activity were mixed. Transportation firms saw stronger activity in the Kansas City District. Demand for air travel was stable in the Dallas District. Port activity remained strong in the Richmond, Atlanta, and Dallas Districts, and ports continued to get diverted traffic from the West Coast, according to Richmond's report. Rail traffic held steady or declined in reporting districts. Demand for trucking services was characterized as brisk in the New York District, while slight increases relative to the last report were noted in Richmond. Trucking activity expanded year over year in the Atlanta District, but fell in the Philadelphia District. Trucking firms in the Dallas District saw mixed demand. Reports on freight volumes were mixed in the Cleveland District, and contacts seeing softer demand cited the slowdown in the steel and energy industries as a source of the weakness. Air freight volumes declined in the Dallas District, while intermodal transportation and transport of seasonal goods increased, according to Cleveland's report.       Construction and Real Estate        Residential real estate activity and construction expanded in most districts since the prior report, and outlooks were largely positive. Homes sales rose strongly in the Minneapolis District on a year-over-year basis, while more modest to moderate gains were reported by all of the remaining districts, except for Philadelphia where builders reported mixed conditions for new  home sales and brokers noted slightly slower existing-home sales in April on a year-over-year basis.              Sales of low- and medium-priced homes outpaced sales of higher-priced homes in the Kansas City District. Contacts in the Cleveland District said most new-home contracts were in the move-up price points, while the Dallas District noted declining sales in Houston for mid-priced new homes. Tight inventories were restraining sales growth in the Boston and New York Districts, although pending sales were up in the Boston District, suggesting that closings would rise in coming months. Home prices rose across much of the country, which contacts in some districts attributed to low inventories relative to demand.              Residential construction was flat to up during the reporting period, although a few districts reported a slower pace of homebuilding activity due to financing and capacity constraints and severe weather. Residential construction activity increased slightly in the Chicago District, where contacts expressed concern that the current strong pace of apartment construction was unsustainable. Homebuilding was flat in the Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts. Rainfall delayed lot deliveries and new home starts in the Dallas District, and several builders in the Cleveland District commented that there is desire to build more speculative homes, but capacity and financing constraints have made it difficult to increase inventory.              Apartment demand was strong in the Dallas District, and held steady in the Richmond District. Tight inventories and strong sales continued to push up prices, except for at the high end of the Manhattan market, according to New York's report. Condo sales rose in the Richmond District, but declined in the Boston District. Rents and prices increased in districts that commented on them, and one San Francisco District contact said that high apartment prices have led young buyers to consider single-family homes. Strength in multifamily construction was reported in the Cleveland, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts, and the Richmond District continued to experience steady apartment building activity.              Commercial real estate leasing and construction activity improved in most districts, and outlooks were optimistic. The New York District reported a strengthening industrial market and steady office and retail leasing demand. In the Boston District, demand for office space held steady at a decent to solid pace, except for in Hartford where demand was slow. The Dallas District continued to see active industrial, retail, and office leasing activity, with the exception of the Houston office market. Both commercial real estate development and leasing activity increased across the San Francisco District, mostly fueled by growth in the technology industry. Contacts in the St. Louis District noted a tight office market for Class A space, and continued commercial and industrial construction. Commercial building increased in the Chicago District driven by demand for industrial and office space, and new hotel and office development in downtown Chicago was compelling retailers to relocate. The Cleveland and Atlanta Districts noted increased construction backlogs, and shortages of skilled labor remained a constraint on construction activity in some districts, such as Boston, Cleveland, and San Francisco.       Banking and Finance        Lending activity increased during the reporting period. Several districts, including Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and San Francisco reported modest to moderate increases in loan volumes. The New York District noted a strong, broad-based pick up in loan demand since the previous report; however, the Dallas District reported slower overall growth. Commercial and industrial loan demand improved in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts, though it was characterized as stable in the Richmond and Kansas City Districts. Business lending expanded at a slower pace in the Dallas District, and the Chicago District saw an uptick in loan demand from small and large businesses, but weaker middle-market lending activity, particularly from the oil and gas industry. Commercial real estate financing held steady in the Kansas City District, while exhibiting continued strong growth in the New York, Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas Districts.               On the consumer lending side, several districts noted increased demand for auto loans, including Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Dallas. Demand for credit cards fell in the St. Louis District, but grew strongly according to Philadelphia's report.              Reports on mortgage lending were mixed. Residential real estate lending rose in the San Francisco District, where one contact reported increased hiring of loan originators, processors, and underwriters to meet growing mortgage demand. The Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts reported an uptick in residential mortgage loans, and contacts in the Cleveland District said the increase in residential mortgage demand was largely for new home purchases. Refinancing activity was unchanged in the New York District; however, it weakened in the Richmond and Chicago Districts. Home equity loan demand rose in the Cleveland District, but was characterized as low in the Chicago District.              Credit conditions generally remained stable or improved. Widespread declines in delinquency rates were seen in the New York and St. Louis Districts, and delinquencies edged down in the Cleveland District from already low levels. Most bankers in the Philadelphia and Kansas City Districts expressed continued confidence in the quality of their loan portfolios. The Dallas District reported that default rates and charge-offs were at all-time lows, and consumer credit quality improved slightly in the Chicago District.              Credit standards remained largely unchanged, with a few exceptions. The Philadelphia and St. Louis Districts noted slight easing of credit standards for mortgages and C&I loans, respectively. Competition among some lenders led to looser credit standards in the Atlanta District, and contacts in the San Francisco District commented that some financial institutions were relaxing lending standards or looking for new revenue sources in part due to downward pressure on net interest margins.       Agriculture and Natural Resources  Agricultural conditions improved for most reporting districts, except for in San Francisco where drought conditions persisted. Significant rainfall alleviated drought conditions and/or improved growing conditions in much of the Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Overly wet areas in the Richmond and St. Louis Districts dried enough for planting to move ahead, while in the Dallas District wet field conditions prevented some producers in South Texas from planting crops in time. Crop planting was underway across the reporting districts and progressing at an above-average pace in the Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Districts, and for soybeans in the Atlanta District. Contacts across several districts reported that crop prices for cotton, wheat, corn, and soybeans remained low and in some cases moved lower over the reporting period, while cattle prices remained historically high. The St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts said farm income declined. The Chicago District said poultry flocks were hit hard by avian flu, and the Minneapolis District noted that the outbreak was expected to cost Minnesota producers more than $300 million.              Reports indicated that oil and natural gas drilling activity continued to decline in the Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, while the Cleveland District said the number of rigs operating in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions leveled out in April after sharp declines in the first quarter. A survey of energy services firms in the Minneapolis District showed that 75 percent of respondents had lower revenues than a year ago and half had lower capital expenditures, and contacts in the Dallas District also noted a drop in capital expenditures this year. The Kansas City District reported continued layoffs at regional oil and gas firms, but contacts said that if a further rebound in oil prices occurs and holds, drilling could ramp back up later this year. Coal production declined in the Richmond and St. Louis Districts but was little changed in the Cleveland District. The Cleveland District noted declines in coal prices over the reporting period while coal prices were reported as flat in the Richmond District.       Employment, Wages, and Prices        Employment levels were up slightly across districts over the reporting period. Reports of hiring came from a variety of industries, and the Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, and St. Louis Districts noted employment gains in manufacturing. Some instances of layoffs were mentioned by the St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts. The Richmond District cited employment declines in West Virginia's coal and gas industries and the Minneapolis District said online job openings in the energy-producing area of North Dakota were down significantly from a year ago. Reports of labor shortages spanned several districts including Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City. An ongoing and widespread shortage of truck drivers was noted in the New York, Cleveland, and Kansas City Districts. Firms in the Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Minneapolis Districts reported difficulty retaining employees. The New York District said a sizeable proportion of service-sector firms plan to expand employment in the months ahead.              Slight growth in wages was reported by most districts. A tight market for skilled construction labor in the Boston, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts pushed up wages for workers there, and staffing services firms in Boston, New York, and Dallas noted rising wages. The Richmond, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts noted higher wages in the restaurant and/or hospitality industries. Some contacts in the IT sector in the San Francisco District reported rapid wage gains, and their counterparts in Boston noted rising wages as well. Employers in the Atlanta District were monitoring how recent minimum pay announcements from a number of employers would affect local labor markets. Contacts across various industries in the Chicago District reported a willingness to raise wages when necessary to attract and retain workers, and a notable share of reporting firms in the Minneapolis District also said they were increasing starting pay for most job categories to attract new hires.              Districts reported stable or slightly increased prices overall during the reporting period. Several districts--Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Kansas City--noted softer input prices in the manufacturing sector, while the Richmond District reported that manufacturing prices paid accelerated slightly, and manufacturers in the New York and Dallas Districts said input prices were stable. The New York District reported upward pressure on input costs among service sector firms, and there were reports of increased transportation costs and/or fuel prices in the Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Selling prices rose among service-sector firms in the Philadelphia and San Francisco Districts, among manufacturers and retailers in the Richmond District, and among retailers and restaurants in the Kansas City District. Manufacturers in the Cleveland District were reluctant to pass through lower input prices to customers. Selling prices were stable in the New York and St. Louis Districts and among retailers in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts. Low oil prices and the strong dollar reduced input and transportation costs for agricultural producers in the San Francisco District, putting downward pressure on prices in that sector.",2015-06-03
107,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and based on information collected before July 3, 2015.

Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas reported that contacts were optimistic about future growth, while Chicago and San Francisco cited optimism coming from specific sectors.                 Improvements in consumer spending varied by District. Some Districts indicated that low energy prices helped boost spending, while some border Districts noted weakness tied to the rising dollar. Automobile sales increased in almost all Districts. Tourism expanded in most regions, except New York where activity slowed.             Nonfinancial services experienced moderate growth since the previous report. Boston, Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas noted strength in professional and business services.

Reports on residential and commercial real estate markets were positive. Home sales increased for most Districts, although Philadelphia and Dallas reported sales were mixed, and New York reported a decline in sales volume. Most Districts noted home price appreciation. Residential construction activity varied across most of the country. Commercial real estate activity increased at a modest pace for several Districts, while non-residential construction, especially multifamily, was strong in many Districts.             Lending activity increased since the last report. Real estate lending was up in half of the Districts. Consumer lending, particularly auto loans, rose in several Districts. Districts that reported on delinquency rates indicated that they were low. Credit quality and credit standards were mostly unchanged since the previous report.             Among Districts reporting on agriculture, rainfall damaged crops in Chicago and St. Louis but helped improve growing conditions in Dallas. Oil and natural gas drilling declined in Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas. Coal production was flat in Cleveland and down in Richmond. Energy related capital expenditures were down in some Districts.             Across Districts, employment levels increased or were steady in most sectors, although there were some reports of layoffs in manufacturing and energy industries. Labor market tightness was reported in Boston, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas.             Most Districts cited only modest wage pressures aside from positions that required specialized skills or were in high-demand. Prices for inputs and finished goods remained steady since the previous report.       Consumer Spending and Tourism       Consumer spending increased across all Districts since the previous reporting period, albeit at varying degrees. Philadelphia, Cleveland, and San Francisco noted that low energy prices were a contributing factor to improved consumer spending at some retail locations and restaurants. The strengthening dollar was cited by Minneapolis and Dallas as the cause of soft growth along border areas. Among Districts reporting on auto sales, sales were up except in St. Louis, where sales were mixed. Cleveland, Chicago, and Kansas City noted a shift in product mix from cars towards SUVs and light trucks. St. Louis reported increased activity in auto service and parts departments, with some contacts attributing this to customers investing in their own cars rather than purchasing new vehicles. Contacts in Chicago expect to record higher overall sales for 2015 due to further strengthening of new and used vehicle sales, and the outlook in Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Dallas remains optimistic.             Tourism improved in Districts reporting on the sector, with the exception of New York, where there were further signs of slowing. Richmond reported slightly stronger activity compared with a year ago, while Atlanta and Minneapolis indicated conditions were solid. Tourism strengthened somewhat in Kansas City but was lower than last year, and Philadelphia and San Francisco reported modest growth. Spending by tourists increased in Philadelphia, Richmond, and Atlanta. New tourist attractions opened in St. Louis.

In Philadelphia, trucking activity continued to show signs of weakness. Dallas indicated trucking volumes remained steady; Richmond cited faster growth rates; and New York described activity as brisk. Warehousing and storage companies in St. Louis noted plans for new hiring and expansion. Cleveland attributed increases in freight shipments to seasonal factors and a clearing of cargo backlogs at West Coast ports. Ports in Richmond reported record volumes in container freight along with higher shipments of autos, and Atlanta ports cited double-digit increases in container trade and break bulk cargo. However, Atlanta and Dallas reported lower volumes in ocean shipping since the last report. Atlanta noted year-to-date railroad shipments were flat compared with the same period last year, as well as a decline in overall air cargo tonnage. Contacts in Cleveland have a moderate outlook for growth over the short term; the outlook in Kansas City is positive going forward; and contacts in Dallas anticipate strong demand in the third quarter.       Manufacturing       Manufacturing activity was uneven across Districts from mid-May through June. Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago reported that business activity increased. Boston reported mostly positive conditions, and St. Louis indicated that plans for manufacturing activity were positive since the previous report. In contrast, Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas reported a decline in activity. Minneapolis indicated mixed business activity, while New York and San Francisco reported flat conditions. Boston, Cleveland, and Dallas noted the strong dollar was dampening export demand, and slowdowns in the oil and gas industry were said to be negatively affecting orders in Cleveland, Chicago and Dallas.             Auto manufacturers and industry suppliers in some Districts reported strong demand, with the exception of Cleveland, which reported year-over-year declines in production at auto assembly plants. Boston and San Francisco indicated that semiconductor manufacturing was either strong or on the upswing. With only a few exceptions, fabricated and primary metal producers cited strong demand and solid growth was reported in the aerospace, construction, and plastics and rubber industries. Mixed or flat growth was reported in the chemical, electronics, food, and high-tech industries.             Similar to current conditions, the outlook varied across Districts, with some expecting moderate improvements in demand and others expecting flat or weaker conditions.       Real Estate and Construction       Several Districts reported that residential real estate activity had increased during the reporting period, including Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City. Additionally, New York indicated that housing markets continued to improve and Dallas noted that residential real estate activity generally remained solid.

Richmond, St. Louis, and Minneapolis indicated that activity was mixed. Cleveland reported that single-family starts picked up across most of the District; Atlanta noted that construction was up from the year-ago level, and Kansas City indicated that residential construction expanded. Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco each reported contacts having positive residential real estate outlooks.             Several Districts, including Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City, indicated that commercial real estate activity was mostly positive and that it continued to increase at a modest to moderate pace. Low and declining vacancy rates were highlighted by several Districts, including Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas. New York reported that availability rates varied by submarket and property type. Rents were noted as being up slightly, increasing, or rising in Philadelphia, Richmond, and Dallas. Some Districts, like Philadelphia and Cleveland, indicated that nonresidential construction activity continued at its previous pace, while other Districts such as Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, noted an increased level of nonresidential construction activity. Multifamily construction was described as strong, elevated, robust, and picking up by several Districts, including New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Dallas and San Francisco. Commercial real estate outlooks remained fairly favorable. Philadelphia was generally optimistic, Atlanta remained positive; Kansas City expected strengthening in the months ahead; and Dallas remained cautiously optimistic.       Banking and Financial Services       Overall demand for loans during the reporting period increased in New York, Richmond, Atlanta, and Dallas, and was stable in Kansas City. Consumer loan demand was steady in Chicago and Kansas City. Commercial loan demand increased in New York, strengthened in Richmond, and remained robust in San Francisco.

Cleveland noted seasonal increases in mortgage loans, and Richmond reported a modest increase. Real estate lending was flat in Philadelphia, and increased in St. Louis. Mortgage refinancing increased in Atlanta and held steady in Chicago. Several Districts including Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, and San Francisco, reported increased consumer lending, with particularly strong growth in auto loans. Competitive pricing for prime auto loans in Chicago led to further expansion of sub-prime auto lending. Revolving credit for consumers expanded in San Francisco. Home equity lending increased in Cleveland and Atlanta, where banks faced increased competition for loans from nonbank lenders.             Credit quality was unchanged in New York, Cleveland, and Kansas City, remained strong in Dallas, and improved in San Francisco. Richmond reported credit quality was stable with a slight decline in rural areas of the District. Delinquencies were lower in New York, remained at low levels in Cleveland and Chicago, and remained modest in San Francisco. Boston's report noted low interest rates and generous terms for commercial real estate mortgages and construction loans. Credit standards were largely unchanged in other Districts including Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas, while there were mixed changes in Richmond. Deposit levels increased in St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco, and remained stable in Kansas City.       Agriculture and Natural Resources       Agricultural conditions were mixed. Significant rainfall affected several Districts, with crop damage reported by Chicago and St. Louis. Chicago also noted disruptions to grain shipping caused by high Mississippi River water levels. Kansas City reported that heavy rains resulted in lowered expectations for the winter agricultural harvest, although the rain also improved soil moisture for developing crops and pastures. Dallas reported that rainfall relieved drought and improved growing conditions. Drought continued in San Francisco, although agricultural output generally expanded over the reporting period. Atlanta reported soybean and cotton plantings were close to their five-year averages. Minneapolis indicated crop progress was ahead of schedule and saw no new outbreaks of avian flu among poultry stock. Chicago and San Francisco noted the avian flu outbreak resulted in higher prices for poultry and eggs. Kansas City said beef cattle production was lower than last year, holding cattle prices high. San Francisco also mentioned low cattle supply as ranchers replenished herds. San Francisco reported demand for forestry products remained flat as foreign demand slowed and domestic gains were limited.             Reports continued to reflect decreases in oil and natural gas drilling activity in Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas. Coal production continued to decline in Richmond and St. Louis and was little changed in Cleveland. Natural gas production was unchanged in Richmond since the previous report and growth slowed in Kansas City. Steady withdrawals of crude oil inventories continued in Cushing, Oklahoma, as seasonal demand for petroleum products picked up and refinery utilization rates rose, according to reports from Kansas City. Refinery utilization rates also remained strong in Dallas. Reports of capital spending declines continued in Cleveland, Atlanta, and Dallas, resulting in some labor cutbacks in Atlanta and Dallas. Heavy machinery manufacturers in Chicago noted weak demand from the oil and gas industry for mining equipment. Accounting firms in Dallas reported growing activity in mergers and acquisitions among oil and gas related firms, while bankers in Atlanta continued to report a slowdown in lending tied to the energy sector.       Employment, Wages, and Prices       Employment levels picked up in various industries across Districts since the last reporting period. Service-related firms in particular experienced payroll expansion in Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, and Dallas. New York and St. Louis noted increased demand for human resource professionals to recruit new employees. Reports from manufacturing firms were mixed, with Cleveland, Richmond, and St. Louis noting increased job openings and/or payroll gains, whereas manufacturers in Boston and Dallas cited layoffs. Although downsizing continued in the energy sector in Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas, the pace abated in Dallas since the last report. Accounts of sustained labor market tightness spanned several Districts, including Boston, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas. Firms from several Districts continued to describe shortages for particular types of skilled labor, predominantly in the construction industry.             Wage pressures were modest across most areas of the country, outside of some specialized skill and high-demand occupations in sectors such as information technology, transportation, and construction. Reports from Kansas City and San Francisco were more robust, indicating intensifying wage pressure across a broader range of industries. Cleveland, Chicago, and San Francisco all highlighted a growing sense among business contacts that recent announcements of minimum wage hikes and pay increases at a number of large retailers could prompt broader wage pressure across other industries as firms compete to remain attractive employers.             Inflation pressures remained largely unchanged since the last report. Reports from Boston, New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago indicated that retail price growth was subdued. Richmond reported that retail price growth slowed, while Kansas City saw an acceleration in retailers' input and selling prices. Atlanta and San Francisco highlighted the dampening effect on the cost of imported goods and commodities from the appreciating dollar and softness in commodity prices.",2015-07-15
108,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston based on information collected on or before August 24, 2015. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.         Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate economic activity continued expanding across most regions and sectors during the reporting period from July to mid-August. Six Districts cited moderate growth while New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas reported modest increases in activity. The Cleveland District noted only slight growth since the last report. In most cases, these recent results represented a continuation of the overall pace reported in the July Beige Book. Respondents in most sectors across Districts expected growth to continue at its recent pace, but the Kansas City report cited more mixed expectations.                 District reports on manufacturing activity were mostly positive, although among these, the Cleveland, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts painted a somewhat mixed picture across manufacturing sectors. Only the New York and Kansas City Districts cited declines in manufacturing.             Retail contacts in a majority of Districts reported that their sales and revenues continued to expand. By contrast, the Cleveland and Minneapolis Districts cited flat consumer activity since the last report, Atlanta was mixed, and Dallas reported decreased sales year-over-year. Most Districts reported increased auto sales. Among Districts with information on tourism, activity was strong in most reports.             Demand for nonfinancial services, including staffing, generally expanded over the reporting period. Districts mentioning the transportation sector mostly noted activity increases. Districts reporting on the banking sector mostly tallied increases in both business and consumer loan volumes. Credit quality was reported to be improving in most Districts, while credit standards were generally said to be unchanged.             Reports on residential and commercial real estate markets across the Districts were mostly positive. Existing home sales and residential leasing widely improved, with home prices moving up in most areas. Commercial real estate activity also rose in most Districts; commercial construction activity ranged from strong in the Cleveland and Minneapolis Districts to up only slightly in Chicago, while commercial leasing was reported to have increased across the board.             Agricultural conditions were mixed across Districts. Farm contacts indicated that anticipated yields were up for corn and soybeans, but conditions deteriorated in the St. Louis and Kansas City Districts; drought was an ongoing concern in the San Francisco District and was also a factor in parts of the Atlanta and Minneapolis Districts. Districts reporting on the energy sector indicated that conditions were stable to declining; coal production was down in the Richmond and St. Louis Districts, while oil-related activity declined in the Cleveland, Atlanta, and Dallas Districts.             Most Districts reported modest to moderate growth in labor demand, although Boston, Cleveland, and Dallas cited only slight increases in hiring. This tightening of labor markets was said to be pushing wages up slightly in selected industries or occupations, especially in the New York, Cleveland, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts. Across all Districts, input and selling prices were reported to be stable or up only slightly.       Manufacturing       District reports on manufacturing were generally positive during the reporting period. Ten Districts reported stable or positive growth and only two, New York and Kansas City, registered declines. Several areas of strength were noted: Auto sales have generally been above expectations and Cleveland, Richmond, and Chicago all reported strong growth in auto-related manufacturing. Aerospace, particularly commercial aviation, continued as a plus for manufacturing production in the Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco Districts. Demand from the construction industry was strong, with the Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts reporting increases in demand for construction-related goods from lumber to construction machinery. Even in Districts where manufacturing activity expanded, several factors were mentioned as damping demand: The Cleveland, Chicago, and Minneapolis Districts reported weakness in the agricultural sector and declines in demand for agricultural machinery. Falling energy prices have led to a reduction in demand for machinery (reported by Cleveland and Minneapolis) and metals (Chicago and St. Louis). The Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and Dallas Districts cited the strong dollar as a weakening influence. Manufacturing contacts in Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis reported that cheap steel imports were depressing demand and leading to low capacity utilization in that industry; these cheap imports were attributed to the strong dollar and slowing economic growth in Asia. Reports from three Districts explicitly mentioned the Chinese slowdown as a factor, noting reduced demand for wood products (San Francisco), chemicals (Boston), and high-tech goods (Dallas).              District reports cited no major revisions to firms' capital spending plans, although contacts in the Kansas City District, for example, expected recent declines in activity to lead to a curtailment of capital expenditure. In general, District reports indicated the manufacturing outlook was positive; even contacts in Kansas City, one of the two Districts to report a decline in manufacturing activity, were modestly positive about the future.       Consumer Spending and Tourism       During this survey period, retail sales results varied across the Districts. Richmond reported that sales rose sharply, while Philadelphia, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco indicated that consumer spending increased at a moderate pace. Most retail contacts in the St. Louis District said that sales were at or above 2014 levels, but many indicated that these results fell short of expectations. Boston and Atlanta reported mixed results--both Districts had some sources reporting that sales growth was improved or still strong, but other retailers reporting flat or slowing sales. The Minneapolis District noted that retail sales were largely flat. The New York District characterized retail sales as generally sluggish and below plan in July, but on or above plan in early August. Cleveland reported that sales were flat over the survey period and lower compared to a year ago. Retail contacts in the Dallas District reported decreased year-over-year sales, partly attributed to a strong dollar negatively affecting sales along the border area with Mexico. New York and Minneapolis reported that the strong dollar discouraged sales in Canadian border areas. Contacts in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City were optimistic that retail sales will stay on pace or improve in the coming months, while Dallas contacts reported mixed levels of optimism amid expectations of low or no sales growth for the third quarter.             The Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts reported continuing strength in auto sales. Dallas said that sales remained steady over the survey period, and that demand was up compared to last summer. Most auto dealerships located in Upstate New York reported that after picking up in June, vehicle sales remained favorably steady. The Cleveland and Kansas City Districts reported modest year-over-year increases in auto sales, while Richmond reported flat or higher sales over the survey period. Expectations are generally optimistic that auto sales will improve or continue to be strong through the end of the year.             The Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, and Minneapolis Districts reported that travel and tourism activity continued to be strong, and contacts expected these positive trends to continue. Tourism activity in the New York District remained generally soft. Hotel occupancy rates and room rates were flat in New York City, but picked up in other parts of New York State. Restaurant sales were up in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Kansas City Districts.       Nonfinancial Services        Demand for nonfinancial services generally expanded at a modest to moderate rate since the last report. The Kansas City and Dallas Districts cited modest to moderate increases in demand for professional and technical services. Business activity in the software and information technology service sector increased in the Boston and San Francisco Districts. Reports from the Minneapolis and Dallas Districts indicated that accounting activity was strong in recent months. Several Districts, including St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco cited growth in the healthcare services sector. Both the St. Louis and Dallas Districts reported expansion in the food services industry. Dallas District law firms noted increased demand for legal services but activity at legal firms in the San Francisco District continued to be weak. Staffing services contacts from most Districts reported increases in overall labor demand and hiring activity and a tightening labor market, with Districts citing particular shortages of specialized software and IT workers, skilled trade's workers, and truck drivers.             District reports on transportation activity were mixed but mostly positive overall. The Cleveland District reported a contraction in overall freight volume, with decreases in shipments of consumer goods, steel, and energy-related products, but increases in shipments of electronics and chemicals. The Richmond and Minneapolis Districts noted robust port activity. The Atlanta District reported modest overall growth in transportation, with increases in automobile and machinery shipments. Trucking activity was stable in the Richmond District, but decreased in the Atlanta District. Contacts in the Dallas District reported only slight growth in the transportation services sector, with increases in courier cargo volumes, but decreases in rail cargo volumes. Overall, most nonfinancial services contacts across the Districts were reported to have a positive outlook, expecting business growth to continue through the rest of the year.       Real Estate and Construction       Residential real estate activity improved across the 12 Districts, with home sales and home prices increasing in every District, while construction activity was more mixed. Richmond and Kansas City indicated that sales of low- and medium-priced homes continued to outpace sales of higher-priced homes. Cleveland, Richmond, and San Francisco noted that demand was more robust for multifamily homes. Construction activity was reportedly increasing in most Districts, but was moderate or flat in the Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts. Contacts in the Cleveland District attributed increases in construction activity to expectations of a rise in interest rates, the improving labor market, and rising consumer confidence. However, Cleveland also cited supply-side constraints and difficulty obtaining construction financing. Similarly, Boston noted difficulty in obtaining new construction permits. San Francisco reported that construction activity slowed in some areas due to tighter borrowing conditions and shortages of skilled labor and available land. Contacts in many Districts attributed increases in home prices to robust demand and declining inventory. Inventories continued to decline or stay flat, with the exception of the Kansas City District, where they rose slightly. Boston, New York, and Richmond specifically commented on low inventory leading to bidding wars among buyers. Cleveland builders cited rising construction and land development costs as upward price drivers. New York and Dallas both indicated that prices have climbed for low- to medium-priced homes but price pressures are softer for higher-priced properties. Rental markets remained strong nationwide. Overall, the residential outlook was positive, with the majority of Districts expecting this increased activity to continue.             District reports on commercial real estate were positive on balance. Commercial leasing activity increased in the Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts. Leasing activity was steady in the Philadelphia District, steady or increasing in the New York District, and mixed in the Boston District. Leasing demand was described as very strong in large cities, including Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Dallas, but Houston saw weak leasing demand. Significant office rent increases were reported for downtown Boston and New York City while slight increases were seen in Center City Philadelphia. Retail rents and industrial rents increased in portions of the Richmond District. Contacts in the Boston and Dallas Districts were optimistic or cautiously optimistic about commercial leasing activity moving forward; contacts in the Kansas City District expected modest improvement in leasing demand. Commercial construction activity increased in the Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts. Commercial construction was described as active in the Dallas District, strong-to-robust in the New York and Minneapolis Districts, and steady at a solid pace in the Philadelphia District's urban centers. In urban Boston, office construction activity increased from levels that were seen as below-normal in relation to fundamentals, and elsewhere in the Boston District commercial construction activity was mixed. The outlook for commercial construction was generally positive in the Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts, but risks to growth in construction activity include rising labor costs for skilled workers (noted by Boston and Cleveland contacts), and tighter underwriting standards for construction loans (noted by San Francisco).       Banking and Finance       Reports on banking activity were mostly positive during the reporting period. Overall loan demand increased in most reporting Districts, with the exception of mixed demand in Chicago and steady demand in Kansas City. Growth in loan activity in other Districts ranged from slight in Richmond to moderate in Philadelphia and St. Louis. Though contacts in Atlanta reported moderate growth, bankers in some parts of the District reported a slowdown in lending tied to the energy sector. Commercial and industrial loan demand improved in Philadelphia, Cleveland, and St. Louis, though it was categorized as steady in Kansas City and Dallas and mixed in Richmond. Commercial real estate lenders in Chicago continued to be concerned that valuations were too high; leading some to put limits on the size of loans they make for financing new purchases. On the consumer lending side, demand for credit was up in most Districts. Growth in demand for consumer loans was reported to be moderate in Dallas and stable in Cleveland. Several Districts, including Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Chicago, noted strong increases in demand for auto loans, though demand for such loans was flat in St. Louis. Demand for mortgages increased in several Districts, including Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis. Although mortgage lending ticked up in Dallas, growth remained muted due to a limited supply of housing.             Credit conditions remained stable or improved across Districts. Delinquency rates declined across all loan categories in the New York, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts. Credit standards were largely unchanged, with a few exceptions in the Richmond and St. Louis Districts who noted tightening standards. Contacts in Boston, Atlanta, and Chicago, reported competition among lenders for loans. Bankers in New York, Cleveland, and San Francisco reported narrow net interest margins.       Agriculture, Oil, and Other Resource-based Industries       Harvests were underway in many Districts and agricultural conditions mostly continued to improve during the reporting period; however, conditions deteriorated in the St. Louis and Kansas City Districts and were mixed in the Chicago District. Anticipated soybean yields were high, despite extensive damage to St. Louis District crops from record rainfall earlier this year and uneven conditions in the Chicago District. High corn yields nationally reduced the cost of feed, and positive cow-calf margins made up for low crop prices in some areas. Cattle prices increased in the Minneapolis and Dallas Districts, and decreased in Chicago. Egg production remained sluggish, as poultry houses continued to replace birds lost to the avian flu earlier this year. The Kansas City District reported financial strain in regions most dependent upon crop production as prices fell and credit conditions worsened. Similarly, capital spending and demand for agricultural equipment decreased in Minneapolis, while Dallas District farmers managed costs in the face of low expected revenues. The Atlanta and Minneapolis Districts experienced some isolated severe drought, and San Francisco expressed serious concerns about drought and inadequate water resources affecting future harvests.             The energy sector was flat or down in all Districts. Respondents in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts revised expectations to deal with a long term low-price environment for oil; meanwhile drilling activity rose slightly in Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas despite depressed demand. In Cleveland, drilling activity in the Marcellus and Utica Shales fell further, to 60 percent of the peak level in the fourth quarter last year. Hiring in oil and gas industries was modest in Cleveland, and firms were cutting jobs in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts. Energy-related capital expenditures were down in the Cleveland and Dallas Districts and mixed in Atlanta, where large firms were reassessing deep water projects but small firms expanded activities and refiners continued to invest in expansion. Coal production was down in the Richmond and St. Louis Districts, and mining activities decreased in the Minneapolis District. Natural gas production was up year-over-year in the Cleveland District, and flat in Richmond.       Employment, Wages, and Prices       Most Districts reported slight or modest growth in employment since the previous Beige Book. Boston reported little or no hiring except via its staffing sector, while Philadelphia, Cleveland, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas cited slight to modest increases in employment. Atlanta, Richmond and Chicago experienced moderate increases in employment, and San Francisco reported an increase in IT sector hiring. The New York labor market reportedly gained further momentum and saw strong growth in hiring. The Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts reported labor shortages for certain skills or difficulty finding workers, especially for IT and other technical positions. Firms in the Atlanta District cited challenges retaining employees and filling vacancies.             Wages were relatively stable in most Districts, with slight to moderate increases since the last report. However, several Districts reported increasing wage pressures caused by labor market tightening. St. Louis reported almost three-fifths of responding firms had raised wages in the last three months. New York cited increased pressure on starting salaries, while Cleveland noted intensifying wage pressure in the construction, retail, and transportation sectors. San Francisco reported upward wage pressures for skilled workers in the IT, information security, and construction sectors. In the Kansas City District, wage growth slowed in many sectors despite selected labor shortages. Dallas noted flat wages, but also wage pressures for some specialty skills.             Both input and output prices remained stable in most Districts. The Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts all reported that prices were mostly flat or had increased only slightly. In Richmond, retail and finished goods prices accelerated slightly, while in Kansas City prices were mixed, with retail input and output prices increasing at a modest pace while manufacturing and crop prices decreased moderately.",2015-09-02
109,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and based on information collected on or before October 5, 2015. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.                Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts point to continued modest expansion in economic activity during the reporting period from mid-August through early October. The pace of growth was characterized as modest in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts, while the Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts described growth as moderate. Boston and Richmond reported that activity increased. Kansas City, on the other hand, noted a slight decline in economic activity. Compared with the previous report, the pace of growth is said to have slowed in the Richmond and Chicago Districts. A number of Districts cite the strong dollar as restraining manufacturing activity as well as tourism spending. Business contacts across the nation were generally optimistic about the near-term outlook.                 Consumer spending grew moderately in the latest reporting period. Most Districts reported that non-auto sales grew at a modest or moderate rate, while vehicle sales generally grew more strongly; tourism across the nation was mixed. Nonfinancial services activity generally strengthened since the previous report, although freight transport activity weakened.             Manufacturing turned in a mixed but generally weaker performance during the latest reporting period, with a number of Districts noting adverse effects from the energy sector. Some strength was reported in the motor vehicles, aerospace, and transportation equipment industries, while metals industries were generally weaker--in part, due to the strong dollar.             Both the housing and commercial real estate markets improved since the last report. Home prices and sales volume increased in almost all regions, and a number of Districts noted relative strength in the market for lower or moderately priced homes. Both residential rental markets and commercial real estate markets were mostly stronger. Commercial and residential multi-family construction showed further strength; single-family construction activity was more mixed but did increase modestly.             Reports on the banking and finance sector were generally positive--lending activity increased, loan quality was steady to improved, and lending standards were little changed or somewhat easier.             Agricultural conditions were mixed. Growing conditions and farm output were solid in some Districts, but there were adverse effects from droughts in the south, as well as excessive rainfall in the Richmond and St. Louis Districts. Lower crop and livestock prices raised concerns that farm income may weaken. Activity in the energy industry weakened since the last report.             Labor markets tightened in most Districts, with some reports of labor shortages--particularly for skilled workers. Wage growth was mostly subdued, though there were scattered reports of increased wage pressures. Prices remained fairly stable across the nation, as most Districts reported that prices of both inputs and finished goods were little changed or up only slightly, though some Districts report declines for energy, as well as other inputs.       Consumer Spending and Tourism Consumer spending grew at a moderate pace over the latest reporting period. Most Districts indicated that non-auto retail sales expanded at a modest or moderate rate. New York and Atlanta characterized sales as mixed, while Richmond and Chicago noted that growth slowed; Kansas City, however, indicated that sales weakened slightly. Contacts were described as generally optimistic about the sales outlook in the Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts.             Vehicle sales generally increased in the latest reporting period. Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas characterized auto sales as strengthening; New York said they were steady to stronger; and St. Louis and Minneapolis described them as mixed. Modest growth in vehicle sales was reported in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Kansas City Districts.             Tourism was mixed across the nation. Minneapolis and San Francisco indicated increased activity, and Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Chicago reported that tourism was at high or strong levels. In contrast, tourism was seen to have weakened in the New York, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. The strong dollar was mentioned as a restraining factor by New York, Minneapolis, and Dallas.       Nonfinancial Services Nonfinancial services activity generally strengthened since the previous report. The New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported that service-sector activity expanded, on balance, while such activity was reported to be mixed in the Richmond District. Revenues increased for advertising and business services firms in the Boston District, while Dallas reported particularly strong demand for logistics and accounting services and little evidence of negative effects on professional services from lower energy prices. Activity in the technology services sector expanded in the San Francisco District, particularly for cloud-based remote services.             On balance, goods transportation services softened since the previous report. Some declines in shipments and cargo volumes were noted in the Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts, particularly metals and energy-related shipments. Partially offsetting these declines, motor vehicle shipments were said to have increased in the Cleveland and Dallas Districts. In addition, port contacts in the Richmond District noted that exports softened and imports strengthened due to the strong dollar, while port contacts in the Atlanta District reported strong demand across all cargo types. Sturdy demand for trucking services was noted in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts.       Manufacturing       On the whole, manufacturing conditions were generally sluggish. Reports were mixed across Districts, and among those that saw some increase in activity, such improvement was mild. Chicago and St. Louis reported modest growth in manufacturing activity, and Dallas reported that most manufacturers saw an increase in demand since the last report. On the other hand, Cleveland, Richmond, Boston, Minneapolis, and San Francisco all reported that manufacturing activity was flat or mixed, while the remaining four Districts--New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Kansas City--noted that manufacturing activity had declined. Several Districts reported fairly strong growth in activity related to motor vehicles, aerospace, and transportation equipment. Cleveland, Chicago, and San Francisco all reported that the demand for steel remained weak, with the strong dollar and competition from China cited as factors driving this trend. Falling demand from the energy sector was also cited as a source of weakness by a number of Districts. Activity related to primary and fabricated metals was mixed, with Chicago and Kansas City seeing weakness in these sectors, while Philadelphia, St. Louis and Dallas saw some expansion in metals related industries. Demand for high tech manufacturing picked up slightly in the Dallas District, while semiconductor sales slowed in the San Francisco District.       Real Estate and Construction       Residential real estate activity has generally improved since the last report, with almost all Districts reporting rising prices and sales volume. One exception was the Chicago District, where prices and sales volume were generally steady. A number of Districts noted that the market for lower or moderately priced homes has outperformed the high end of the market. The inventory of available homes was reported to be low in the Boston, New York, Richmond, and St. Louis Districts; and San Francisco reported a shortage of available land in some areas. On the other hand, Philadelphia reported adequate inventories, and Dallas noted a fair amount of supply in the pipeline. Boston, New York, and Chicago indicated rising residential rents, while Minneapolis reported sharp declines in rents in energy-producing areas of North Dakota. Residential construction has been mixed but generally stronger in the latest reporting period, with multi-family outpacing single-family construction. Strong multi-family construction was highlighted in the New York, Cleveland, Richmond, and San Francisco Districts, while Atlanta reported strong residential construction generally. However, Minneapolis and Kansas City reported declines in new home construction. Philadelphia mentioned a lack of new construction, while Dallas reported that new construction has been restrained by labor shortages; Chicago indicated little change.             Commercial real estate markets have shown signs of strengthening in all twelve Districts. Most Districts noted improvement across all major segments, though New York and St. Louis noted some increased slack in the market for retail space. Commercial construction was also stronger in most Districts. Boston and St. Louis noted brisk construction in the health sector, including senior care facilities, and Cleveland also indicated strong demand for senior living structures. New York, on the other hand, noted some pullback in new commercial construction, though activity remained fairly brisk.       Banking and Financial Services       Reports from the banking sector were generally positive. Loan demand or volume was reported to be growing in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Other Districts indicated mixed loan demand: New York reported rising demand for commercial loans but declining demand for refinancing, and Kansas City indicated weaker demand for agricultural loans but steady demand in other categories.             Credit conditions were mixed but mostly improved. Improved loan quality or declining delinquency rates were noted in New York, while Cleveland, Richmond, and Kansas City reported little change. Richmond and Chicago indicated some easing in lending standards, while New York, Kansas City, and Dallas reported no change. San Francisco reported tight lending conditions in the residential real estate segment.       Agriculture and Natural Resources Agriculture conditions were mixed. Growing conditions and farm output were solid in some Districts, while either drought or excessive moisture hampered production in other Districts. Several Districts reported lower prices for crops and livestock, raising concerns that farm income may weaken as a result. Drought conditions were seen in parts of the Atlanta and Dallas Districts, and excessive rainfall was reported in the Richmond and St. Louis Districts. Corn and soybean crops were reported as being in excellent shape by Chicago, Minneapolis and Kansas City, and the San Francisco District reported that grain yield has been excellent.             Activity in the energy industry declined further since the last report, particularly in the Minneapolis, Kansas City and Dallas Districts, where the number of active drilling rigs fell. Dallas said that the demand for oilfield services remained depressed, and exploration and production companies reduced business activities in the Atlanta District. Coal production fell in the St. Louis District and in parts of the Richmond District, and natural gas production was flat in the Richmond District.       Employment, Wages and Prices Labor markets generally tightened since the previous report. The New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts indicated that employment was up modestly to moderately. Boston reported that most advertising and consulting firms planned to increase hiring, while manufacturers were cutting staff. Many Districts continued to report that employers were having difficulty finding skilled workers, and, in some cases, unskilled workers. Scattered labor shortages were reported in construction (Cleveland, Chicago, San Francisco), trucking (New York, St. Louis, Kansas City), and information technology (New York, Kansas City, San Francisco). However, contacts in the Philadelphia District noted relatively more growth of part time and temporary positions compared to full-time positions, and Dallas reported that layoffs in the energy industry were still underway.             Wage growth remained subdued in most Districts since the previous report. The Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts noted only slight to modest wage increases. To the extent that more significant wage increases were observed, they were largely concentrated among highly skilled workers in information technology, health care, professional services, and some of the skilled trades. However, New York noted increased wage pressure for both skilled and less skilled workers, and San Francisco noted that the impact of higher minimum wages implemented over the past year began to filter through to the retail sector and resulted in increased wages for some lower-skilled workers.             Price pressures were said to be contained, as most Districts reported that both input and finished goods prices were little changed or up only slightly since the previous report. Contacts in the Kansas City District noted that prices grew more slowly than in recent months, and eased in some sectors. Moreover, low or declining prices for energy products, technology goods, some agricultural commodities, and metals were cited by some Districts.",2015-10-14
110,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and based on information collected before November 20, 2015. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.         The twelve Federal Reserve District reports indicate that economic activity increased at a modest pace in most regions of the country since the previous Beige Book report. Economic growth was modest in the Districts of Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas and San Francisco. In the Minneapolis District the economy grew moderately, while in the Kansas City District growth was steady on balance with mixed conditions across sectors. In the New York District economic conditions leveled off since the previous report, and in the Philadelphia District aggregate business activity continued to grow at a modest pace. In the Boston District, growth was somewhat slower despite reports of revenue increases.                 Consumer spending increased in nearly all Districts since the previous Beige Book, with the pace of sales ranging from sluggish in New York to moderate in Minneapolis and San Francisco. Sales of light vehicles remained robust in recent weeks, with low gasoline prices helping to boost sales of light trucks and larger vehicles. Inventory levels were satisfactory.             Tourism was mixed across reporting Districts. In the Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis and Dallas Districts, tourism grew in recent weeks. In the New York District, activity was at or below year-ago levels.             Non-financial services were little changed to stronger, with most of the growth in technology-related services. Transportation activity was softer on balance since the previous report. Port activity remained strong, although largely on the strength of imports, as exports continued to fall. Cargo volume in Dallas remained soft in recent weeks due to the slowdown in energy-related cargo.             Conditions in the manufacturing sector were mixed in recent weeks. The strong dollar, low commodity prices, and weak global demand were named by several Districts as factors for constrained demand. The Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis and Dallas Districts reported improvements since the previous Beige Book report, while the New York, Philadelphia and Minneapolis Districts reported declines in manufacturing activity. The Boston, St. Louis and Kansas City Districts reported solid capital investment plans. Manufacturers in most Districts looked for slightly improved business conditions in the next six months.             On balance, housing markets improved at a moderate pace since the previous Beige Book, and home prices increased modestly. Home sales rose in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago and Kansas City Districts. Philadelphia described a ""slow growth market"" in which inventories were stable at low levels. Housing inventories continued to fall year-over-year in the Boston, Cleveland, Richmond and St. Louis Districts.             Residential construction grew at a modest to moderate pace since the previous report. The New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis and Kansas City Districts reported growth in residential construction, while construction in Dallas and Minneapolis was flat.             Commercial construction strengthened modestly in most Districts. However, the Minneapolis District saw continued strong growth, particularly in cities where commercial permitting increased. In contrast, New York reported little change. Commercial leasing activity generally grew at a moderate pace in recent weeks. Activity increased in the Districts of Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco, but was unchanged in the New York District.             Loan demand increased according to a majority of Districts that report on the sector. Residential mortgage demand was stable on balance. Demand for home equity loans and lines of credit rose in the Richmond and Dallas Districts. Commercial loan demand was reported to be generally strengthening in most Districts. Credit quality was mostly stable. San Francisco noted an increasing role of nontraditional lenders in mortgage markets.             Agricultural conditions varied across Districts in recent weeks. Rainfall helped alleviate drought conditions in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts, while in the Richmond and St. Louis Districts crops suffered from too much moisture. Energy activity declined mildly with limited gas exploration being undertaken. Investment fell at oil and gas exploration and services firms in the Atlanta District as a result of continued weak global demand and an oversupply of oil. The Dallas, St. Louis, Kansas City and San Francisco Districts reported declines in energy activity.             Labor markets continued to tighten modestly, on balance, since the previous Beige Book. The Atlanta, Kansas City and Dallas Districts reported a slight pickup in hiring, while the remaining Districts characterized their increase as modest to moderate. Many Districts indicated that increased hiring was driven by temporary and entry-level positions that were being fulfilled by staffing firms. Employers in several districts reported difficulty finding skilled craftsmen and general laborers in the construction industry. However, the Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City and San Francisco Districts said that difficulties were spreading to lower skilled and entry-level positions. Most Districts said that wage pressures increased only for skilled occupations and for workers that were in short supply.             Prices were generally steady. Input and finished goods prices were stable for manufacturing firms, according to most Districts. Some prices were lower due to further declines in commodity and energy prices as well as the strong dollar. Agricultural commodity prices were also lower. Some upward price pressures were reported by nonmanufacturing firms in the New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Kansas City and San Francisco Districts.       Consumer Spending and Tourism Consumer spending increased in nearly all Districts since the previous Beige Book, although the gains varied. The Atlanta District reported that retail sales rose slightly above expectations and that the holiday outlook among retailers was optimistic. The pace of growth was modest in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts. Chicago District retailers reported that inventories were at comfortable levels. In the Boston District, demand remained strong for home-related items, and in the Cleveland District, revenue increases were driven in part by gasoline and home furnishings. Spending in the New York District was described as generally sluggish, and inventories were up somewhat, but said to be at satisfactory levels. Reports were mixed in the Boston, Richmond and Dallas Districts. While consumer spending declined in the Kansas City District, contacts expected sales to increase slightly in coming months. The remaining Districts reported moderate consumer spending. In the San Francisco District, sales of online games remained brisk and demand for pharmaceutical products remained robust.             Sales of light vehicles continued to rise since the previous report. Several Districts noted that dealerships credited low gasoline prices for boosting sales. In the Atlanta and Cleveland Districts, auto dealers reported a rise in the sale of larger vehicles, which they attributed to low gasoline prices. Dealers in the Chicago District reported continued strong sales and said that leasing activity increased noticeably. In the San Francisco District auto sales were very strong, propelled in part by low sales prices and incentives. In contrast, the Kansas City District noted that auto sales dropped markedly.             Among those Districts reporting on tourism, activity was mixed. Boston-area business travel remained strong, although leisure travel decreased a bit. In New York City, revenues at hotels and Broadway theatres were at or slightly below year-ago levels. Philadelphia District tourism was reported as growing at a modest pace through the fall. Richmond and Atlanta indicated that tourism increased robustly, and sources in both Districts were optimistic in their outlook. Favorable weather in the Minneapolis District was reportedly a factor for sustained tourism in the fall, and a national park in Montana surpassed the all-time annual records for visitation for the second year in a row, despite summer forest fires. Tourism in the Kansas City District continued to decline, but was generally flat year-over-year. In Dallas, overall sales in leisure and hospitality were above expectations, particularly in large metro areas in Texas.       Nonfinancial Services Nonfinancial services activity ranged from flat to slightly stronger since the previous Beige Book report. In Boston, software and information technology firms cited mixed year-over-year revenues. New York reported that activity appeared to level off. In the Richmond District, businesses generally reported no change in revenues, with the exception of the faster growing telecommunications sector. In the St. Louis District, firms in warehousing and storage services, as well as healthcare and social assistance services, planned expansions. Courier services there cited growing e-commerce as driving the need to expand. In Minneapolis, where growth was said to be moderate to strong, professional firms related to health and records management reported expansions. Professional and high-tech firms in the Kansas City District noted moderate increases in activity since the previous survey, with sales well above year-ago levels. Demand for professional and technical services increased moderately in the Dallas District, particularly in accounting. In the San Francisco District, demand for cloud computing services and big-data analytics drove sales of technology services higher, while demand for healthcare services also grew moderately.             Transportation activity was softer on balance in reporting Districts. Much of the growth at the Richmond District ports was from imports; exports continued to weaken, which port officials attributed to the stronger dollar. Record numbers of containers moved through ports in the Atlanta District, but haulers of exported industrial products reported a continued decline in volumes from October through mid-November. Railroads in that District also reported significant year-over-year decreases in total carloads. In the Cleveland District transportation services generally contracted since the previous Beige Book although volumes grew in construction materials and supplies for healthcare and business service providers. Cargo volume in the Dallas District remained soft in recent weeks, due to the slowdown in energy-related cargo. Demand in the Dallas District airline industry was flat overall. The international outlook remained weak, but airlines were positive about the domestic market and noted that as long as fuel prices remain this low, they will continue to perform well.       Manufacturing Conditions in the manufacturing sector were mixed in recent weeks. Several Districts reported that firms continued to cite the strong dollar, low commodity prices, and weak global demand as factors for constrained demand. The Boston and St. Louis Districts reported moderate growth, noting that overall conditions improved since the previous report. Manufacturing in the Richmond, Atlanta and Dallas Districts grew modestly, with reports that new orders and production levels increased slightly. Chicago reported modest growth in the past six weeks. Cleveland, Kansas City and San Francisco stated that manufacturing activity appeared flat on balance. In contrast New York, Philadelphia and Minneapolis reported a decline in manufacturing activity.             Food manufacturers located in the Richmond District noted an improvement in recent weeks, with increased new orders. In Chicago, the auto industry continued to experience solid gains and continued to report plans to expand capacity. Durable goods production improved considerably for aircraft, computer, and electronic equipment products in Kansas City. Additionally, fabricated metals manufacturers and machinery producers reported strong growth in the Dallas District. Demand for high-tech manufacturing also picked up slightly. The Boston, St. Louis and Kansas City Districts reported solid capital investment plans. The Cleveland District said the steel industry continued to struggle because of the strength of the dollar, competition from imports (particularly from China), and low demand from the domestic energy sector. Minneapolis reported a continuing decline in demand for agricultural and mining equipment. Finally, San Francisco noted that deliveries of commercial aircraft were up slightly from a year ago, while new orders were significantly lower. Manufacturers in most Districts looked for slightly improved business conditions in the next six months.       Real Estate and Construction Housing markets grew at a moderate pace on balance, and home prices also increased modestly since the previous Beige Book. Home sales in the Boston and Cleveland Districts rose since the previous report. The Boston District market for condominiums was generally strong, with sales up year-over-year in every state except Connecticut. In the Richmond District, residential real estate increased moderately. Kansas City residential sales strengthened moderately, led by strong gains in Colorado. Residential real estate continued to improve at a mild pace in the New York, Philadelphia and Chicago Districts. Atlanta District real estate contacts indicated that sales activity held steady since the previous report. In the New York District, weakness was noted at the high end of the single family home market, particularly at the high end of New York City's co-op and condo market. Philadelphia described a ""slow growth market"" in which inventories were stable at low levels. Dallas single-family housing activity declined seasonally. Housing inventory continued to fall year-over-year in the Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, and St. Louis Districts.             Residential construction grew at a modest to moderate pace since the previous report. The Cleveland and Chicago Districts reported moderate growth, while New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts reported modest growth in residential construction. In the New York and Atlanta Districts, residential construction was noted as steady. In the New York District, multi-family outpaced single-family construction, with new development largely occurring in or near New York City and suburban rail hubs. In Richmond, single-family home construction grew modestly, while multi-family construction remained strong. Most St. Louis District contacts said that new home construction exceeded that of a year ago. The Kansas City District reported a moderate increase in housing starts, while construction in the Dallas and Minneapolis Districts was flat since the previous report.             Commercial construction strengthened modestly in most Districts since the previous report. The Minneapolis District saw continued strong growth, particularly in cities where commercial permitting increased. The Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts reported moderate commercial construction growth. In the Boston District, office construction grew modestly in the greater Boston region. Demand remained strong in commercial building, multi-family housing, and higher education in the Cleveland District, while in the Atlanta District, non-residential construction was slightly up from a year ago and reports on apartment construction remained robust. The Philadelphia, Richmond and Kansas City Districts reported a modest pace of growth in commercial construction. Commercial construction increased in most major cities in the Richmond District. In contrast, New York reported little change since the previous report. The Dallas District reported that construction remained active, although construction started to taper off in Houston.             Commercial leasing activity generally grew at a moderate pace. Cleveland reported strong growth, while activity in the Districts of Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco expanded at a moderate pace. Commercial real estate improved in the Atlanta District, with increased absorption and rent growth across property types. Improvement in the Chicago District was widely distributed across the retail, industrial, and office segments, with increased demand for both sale and lease properties. Contacts in St. Louis reported slightly higher demand across all sectors, and expected demand to remain the same or increase slightly in the first quarter of 2016. The Minneapolis-St. Paul retail, office, and industrial space had positive net absorption, along with lower vacancy rates. Demand for commercial leasing increased mildly in the Dallas District, while office space activity was strong in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Commercial leasing activity in New York was unchanged since the previous report.       Banking and Financial Services Loan demand increased since the previous Beige Book, according to a majority of Districts that report on the banking and financial services sector. The rise in demand ranged from slight to modest according to the New York, Cleveland, Richmond and Dallas Districts. The Philadelphia and San Francisco Districts reported a moderate rise while the St. Louis District reported the strongest growth. In the Chicago and Kansas City Districts demand was steady. Residential mortgage activity was stable, on balance. The Philadelphia District reported a slight decline in mortgage lending while demand rose slightly according to the Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis and San Francisco Districts. Demand for home equity loans and lines of credit rose in the Richmond and Dallas Districts. Commercial loan demand was reported to be generally strengthening in most Districts. One exception was the Dallas District, which reported softer lending to businesses, but cited seasonal factors as the likely cause.             Credit quality was generally stable. The New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco Districts indicated strengthening credit quality as delinquency rates declined and household balance sheets improved. Credit standards tightened slightly for commercial and industrial loans, according to the New York District, and for residential mortgage and business loans according to St. Louis. Dallas noted some tightening of standards in response to slowly declining loan quality among energy sector loans. Some loosening of standards was reported by Richmond and Chicago.             The lending environment remained competitive in most Districts. Atlanta noted that some community depository institutions found it difficult to compete with loan structures and terms offered by larger institutions. St. Louis said some banks experienced a decline in consumer borrowing due to competition from alternative lenders. Richmond reported that private equity was playing a major role in financing merger and acquisition activity. Similarly, San Francisco noted an increasing role of nontraditional lenders in mortgage markets.       Agriculture and Natural Resources Agricultural conditions varied across Districts in recent weeks. In the Atlanta District heavy showers alleviated drought conditions although soybean, cotton and peanut harvests were behind the five-year average. Rain improved conditions in the Dallas District, where domestic demand for grains and cattle was solid, but export demand was weak. San Francisco contacts reported modest growth, with strong yields in areas less affected by drought. The condition of the Chicago District's corn and soybean crops improved mildly since the previous report, with contacts anticipating a record harvest for soybeans. Minneapolis District agricultural conditions were mixed overall since the last report. Corn, soybean, and sugar beet production hit new records in some states in the Minneapolis District. In contrast, agricultural conditions weakened in the Richmond District since the previous report. South Carolina farmers said conditions deteriorated due to the flooding in early October and recent wet weather, resulting in delayed harvesting of soybeans, peanuts, cotton, and vegetables, as well as lower crop yields. Additionally, the St. Louis and Kansas City Districts reported a moderate decline in agribusiness. St. Louis District farmers noted that extensive rainfall had resulted in lower crop production levels relative to last year, and industry contacts had a mostly negative outlook for farm income.             Energy activity declined mildly in several Districts, although at a similar pace as in previous months, with limited gas exploration being undertaken. Richmond reported mixed conditions, with modest growth in natural gas production. However, additional drilling is on hold due to oversupply. Appalachian coal production remained weak. Activity and investment fell at oil and gas exploration and services firms in the Atlanta District as a result of continued weak global demand and an oversupply of oil. However, petrochemical refiners set capacity and production records. The Dallas District reported modest declines in energy sector demand. Additionally, San Francisco reported a mild decrease in the energy sector. Low oil prices continued to hold down petroleum extraction and exploration plans in the San Francisco District. St. Louis and Kansas City Districts reported a moderate decline in activity. The Kansas City District reported that energy activity declined at a similar pace as in previous months, and the number of oil and gas drilling rigs continued to decline, particularly in Oklahoma and New Mexico.       Employment, Wages, and Prices Labor markets continued to tighten modestly, on balance, since the previous Beige Book. The Atlanta, Kansas City and Dallas Districts reported a slight pickup in hiring while the remaining Districts characterized their increase as modest to moderate. Many Districts indicated that increased hiring was driven by temporary and entry-level positions that were being fulfilled by staffing firms. The exception was the Chicago District, where staffing agencies said activity had slowed. Difficulties finding skilled workers persisted, but varied by location and occupation. The Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City and San Francisco Districts said that difficulties were spreading to lower skilled and entry-level positions. Several Districts reported difficulty finding skilled craftsmen and general laborers in the construction industry. The Dallas and San Francisco Districts noted that labor shortages may have constrained building activity in some areas.             Wage pressures were generally stable to increasing. Most Districts said that wage pressures increased only for skilled occupations and for workers that were in short supply, although a few Districts saw broader pressure. Cleveland said that wage pressures were widespread, especially for higher-skilled jobs, while Atlanta reported signs of emerging pressure to raise starting wages, even among low-skilled jobs. The Atlanta and San Francisco Districts said some companies were revising incentives and benefit programs to retain and attract talent. Chicago, on the other hand, reported some firms cutting benefit packages to contain labor costs. A few Districts mentioned issues related to the minimum wage. For example, contacts in the Boston District cited increased labor costs for restaurants due to changes in minimum wages, and the Chicago District said recent initiatives were putting upward wage pressures on low paying jobs. Finally, the Dallas District reported that some hospitality contacts increased starting pay as a preemptive measure for future minimum wage increases.             Prices were generally steady, although reports varied. Input and finished goods prices were stable for manufacturing firms, according to most Districts. However, the Richmond District indicated an increase in raw materials and finished goods prices while intermediate input prices were slightly lower according to the Boston, Atlanta, St. Louis and Kansas City Districts. In some Districts lower input prices were attributed to further declines in commodity and energy prices as well as the strong dollar. For example, Dallas said that a trucking firm was passing lower fuel costs on to customers and Boston reported that the strong dollar put downward pressure on prices. The Cleveland District noted that some manufacturers were cutting prices to compete with foreign imports. Some upward price pressures were noted by nonmanufacturing firms in the Districts of New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, Kansas City and San Francisco. Price declines were reported for agricultural commodities such as raw milk, cotton, soybean, wheat, chickens, hogs, and cattle. However, the San Francisco District reported that drought conditions reduced cattle herd sizes leading to supply shortages and higher meat prices.",2015-12-02
111,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and based on information collected on or before January 4, 2016. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.  Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that economic activity has expanded in nine of the Districts since the previous Beige Book report and contacts in Boston were described as upbeat. Meanwhile, New York and Kansas City described economic activity in their Districts as essentially flat. Atlanta and San Francisco characterized the growth in their Districts as moderate; Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas described their Districts' growth as modest. Contacts' outlooks for future growth remained mostly positive in Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas. Growth of consumer spending ranged from slight to moderate in most Districts, while auto sales were somewhat mixed, as activity has begun to drop off from previously high levels in some Districts. Reports of tourism activity were also mixed. Among the Districts that reported, nonfinancial services generally grew at a modest or moderate pace, although reports from staffing services and transportation services were somewhat mixed. With the exception of motor vehicles and aerospace, most manufacturing sectors displayed a weakening in activity. Also, fewer Districts reported increases in manufacturing activity than decreases during the latest reporting period. Several Districts reported the strong dollar's negative impact on demand, while some noted that low energy prices have had a smaller, mixed effect. Residential and commercial real estate activity generally improved, according to District reports. Stronger activity tended to be cited for multifamily construction and commercial real estate. House prices and commercial rental rates also rose somewhat in most Districts. Overall, most Districts reported that loan demand grew, credit quality improved, or loan delinquencies fell, with credit standards changing little. Districts reported that agricultural sectors weakened overall, and farm incomes were stressed. Flooding and drought in various regions aggravated the effects of already low and falling prices for farm commodities, caused in part by weak global demand and the strong dollar. Unseasonably warm winter weather in much of the nation further depressed energy prices and slowed significant segments of that sector. Labor markets continued to improve, with employment increases evident in reports from seven Districts. Four Districts mentioned signs of labor market tightening. However, Districts reported little overall change in wage and price pressures, with wage increases running from flat to moderate, while price increases tended to be minimal. Consumer Spending and Tourism Most Districts reported some growth in consumer spending through the holiday season, with the pace of growth typically characterized as ranging from slight to moderate, and as strong in Minneapolis. New York, Richmond, and Dallas noted that sales were sluggish or had softened. Unseasonably warm weather was blamed for damping overall sales in Cleveland, Richmond, and Dallas, and for weaker apparel sales in New York. Richmond and Chicago also noted disappointing clothing sales. Similarly, San Francisco reported that apparel sales at brick-and-mortar stores failed to meet expectations. Minneapolis noted record-breaking online sales, while Cleveland described greater optimism among retailers anticipating enhanced opportunities from e-commerce. Auto sales have continued to be positive in most reporting Districts since the previous Beige Book, with strength reported in Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago. However, Kansas City reported that sales dropped markedly compared with last year, and New York and St. Louis reported recent slowing in activity. Contacts in roughly half of the Districts cited continued lower gas prices as a contributing factor for auto sales, particularly for increases in SUV and light truck sales. Tourism activity varied across reporting Districts. Philadelphia, Dallas, and San Francisco reported overall increases in activity, while Minneapolis and Kansas City reported mixed conditions. New York indicated further weakening. Mild weather negatively impacted ski activity in New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, and Minneapolis but had a positive impact on shore and national parks visits in the Philadelphia and Minneapolis Districts. Richmond, Atlanta, and St. Louis reported positive hotel bookings and occupancy, while New York reported that hotel revenues were down. Nonfinancial Services Overall, nonfinancial services have grown modestly to moderately since the previous Beige Book. Professional and technical services firms saw moderate growth in the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Consulting firms in the Boston District reported strong demand, and the demand for server and cloud computing services continued to rise in the San Francisco District. Contacts in the New York District reported sluggish business activity. Staffing services were somewhat mixed across reporting Districts. Staffing firms in Philadelphia reported strong growth for temporary and permanent placements across a range of sectors, while staffing demand in the Dallas District varied by location. Contacts in New York were somewhat less optimistic about the near-term outlook, while contacts in Boston, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Kansas City continued to expect positive growth. Reports on transportation services varied. Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas contacts noted a surge in e-commerce shipments, and parcel companies in St. Louis reported record holiday-related demand. Richmond District ports reported strong vehicle imports, and Atlanta District ports cited strong retail goods imports year over year; however, both Districts noted softening in exports. Cleveland and Kansas City noted general declines that Cleveland attributed to weakness in the energy and steel sectors, and to the export environment. Manufacturing Manufacturing activity has been varied across Districts since the last Beige Book period, with nearly half of the Districts reporting overall declines. New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City indicated that manufacturing activity declined; however, Cleveland, Richmond, and Chicago reported that manufacturing activity grew modestly to moderately. Dallas characterized its demand as flat or increased, while San Francisco reported that activity was flat to down, on balance. Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Dallas, and San Francisco noted the strong dollar's negative impact on manufacturers' exports. Contacts in Philadelphia and San Francisco also cited weak global demand as contributing to declines. Boston, Cleveland, and Dallas manufacturers reported the benefit of low energy prices on their margins, but Cleveland contacts indicated that the low energy prices did not offset the impact of the strong dollar. Furthermore, suppliers to the oil and gas exploration sector reported weak, and sometimes deteriorating, demand in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City. The motor vehicle and motor vehicles parts industry generally experienced strong demand in Cleveland, Richmond, and Chicago, and announced significant expansions in St. Louis. The aerospace industry was a bright spot for metals manufacturers in Cleveland and Chicago; in Minneapolis, an aircraft producer was expanding for the launch of a new product. Contacts in Boston, Atlanta, Minneapolis, St. Louis, and Kansas City remained optimistic about the near-term outlook for manufacturing growth. Expectations in Philadelphia have weakened significantly since the last Beige Book but have remained positive, while the expectations of manufacturers in Cleveland have been mixed. New York contacts were less optimistic about the near-term outlook. Real Estate and Construction Residential real estate activity as measured in sales was generally positive in New York, Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis. Richmond experienced steady sales with pockets of strength, and Kansas City reported declines. Prices rose slightly to modestly overall in all reporting Districts, and inventories remained low in Boston, Richmond, and Minneapolis, and some parts of the New York District; however, New York City's rental vacancy rate increased. Though Boston contacts expected the market to perform well in 2016, contacts in Cleveland and Kansas City expressed concerns that higher interest rates may slow activity. Residential construction activity was described as modest or moderate in most Districts but was more subdued in New York, Atlanta, and Dallas overall. Multifamily construction continued to be strong in New York, Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco and showed improvement in Chicago. Most reporting Districts characterized nonresidential real estate activity as modest to moderate; Boston and New York indicated little change. Rental rates rose in more than half of the reporting Districts, and vacancy rates were mixed. Most Districts reported modest or moderate growth in commercial construction, and the Dallas District noted high levels of industrial construction in Dallas-Fort Worth. Contacts in the Atlanta District expect construction activity to increase slightly, while contacts in the Philadelphia, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Richmond Districts expect overall commercial real estate activity to continue to strengthen at least modestly. Banking and Finance Lending activity appears to have improved on net. Loan demand grew on balance in the Philadelphia, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts. Cleveland, Richmond, and Kansas City reported stable credit demand, on balance, while Dallas noted some recent softening. Philadelphia reported the strongest loan growth for autos, commercial real estate, and commercial and industrial deals, while residential lending was flat to down. San Francisco noted robust growth of automobile loans and mortgage originations. Atlanta reported an increase in residential mortgage lending and refinancing, while New York reported weaker demand from the household sector, but steady commercial demand. Chicago noted continued strength in auto lending and some slowing of loan demand from small and middle-market businesses, while most other household lending was little changed. The slumping energy sector was cited as a factor for lower loan demand by some contacts in the Cleveland, Richmond, and Atlanta Districts. Credit conditions generally improved. New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, and San Francisco cited improved credit quality, declining delinquencies, or both, in all or part of their Districts. Cleveland reported no change in delinquencies. Dallas contacts noted increasing delinquencies of loans to oil and gas companies. New York, Cleveland, Richmond, and Kansas City reported little or no change in credit standards. Seven Districts described some competitive conditions, including competition from nonbank, online entities, whereas New York cited some narrowing of spreads in all loan categories. However, Chicago noted signs of slight tightening of credit supply. Agriculture and Natural Resources Agricultural reports were generally flat to down. With few exceptions, commodity prices for crops and livestock have remained low or have fallen since the previous reporting period, stressing farm incomes. Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas reported that conditions were not profitable for some producers, as farm input prices have not fallen as fast. These three Districts also cited large harvests as a factor in keeping commodity prices low, while Kansas City and San Francisco reported that weak global demand and the strong dollar held down livestock exports. Drought remained a problem in parts of the San Francisco District for some producers, while heavy rain and flooding continued to impact harvests in the Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Dallas Districts. Most segments of the energy sector struggled further, as oil and gas prices continued to decline. Cleveland and Kansas City reported that warmer-than-normal temperatures throughout much of the nation has further increased already abundant inventories of oil and gas and kept downward pressure on already low energy prices. Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas reported continued declines in oil and gas drilling; several of these Districts noted that affected firms continued to experience serious financial stress and to reduce employment. In contrast, Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Dallas cited positive impacts for oil refineries, and Cleveland reported that investment in pipeline construction continues unabated. Coal production fell in the Richmond and St. Louis Districts, and iron ore mining fell in the Minneapolis District. Employment, Wages, and Prices District labor markets continued to improve. Richmond reported moderate employment increases, while Philadelphia, Chicago, and Dallas reported slight to modest job growth, and Cleveland indicated little change. On balance, New York and Atlanta contacts reported more hiring, than layoffs. Boston and Minneapolis offered mixed examples but both reported that firms had plans to add employees. St. Louis also reported positive hiring expectations. Labor markets were described as tight or tightening in the New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Minneapolis Districts. Staffing firms in New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, and Minneapolis cited various positive signs of strong labor demand, including demand from specific technical sectors in the Boston District to a broad range of sectors in the Philadelphia District. Hiring metrics were reported as flat or mixed from staffing agencies in Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas. Overall, wage pressures remained relatively subdued, as evidenced by reports from Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City. Just two Districts--New York and San Francisco--indicated some acceleration in upward wage pressures. Cleveland, Richmond, and Dallas cited mixed reports, ranging from flat to moderate wage pressures. Seven Districts mentioned greater wage pressures for skilled workers in a variety of industries, including construction, manufacturing, financial, professional, technology, and health-care sectors. However, wage pressures among low-skilled positions were almost as pervasive, with six Districts citing pressure stemming from state minimum wage increases and from labor shortages or turnover among entry-level positions in banking, retail, and hospitality. Nearly all Districts reported that overall price pressures were minimal. Price increases were noted by service-sector firms in New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco, and by retail outlets and restaurants in Richmond and Kansas City. Prices of inputs and finished goods for manufacturers tended to be stable or declining, although Richmond's manufacturing contacts reported rising prices for both. Falling energy prices, as cited by Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas, and lower prices for copper, steel, and other commodities, as cited by Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago, were generally described as contributing to lower input costs for manufacturers. Low oil prices were also credited for reducing home heating costs in Minneapolis and airfares in Dallas. Six Districts reported low or falling prices for most crops and livestock. Chicago and Kansas City contacts indicated that large harvests had contributed to the price declines.",2016-01-13
112,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and based on information collected before February 22, 2016. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.   Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts continued to indicate that economic activity expanded in most Districts since the previous Beige Book report. Economic growth increased moderately in Richmond and San Francisco and at a modest pace in Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Minneapolis. Philadelphia reported a slight increase in economic activity, and St. Louis described conditions as mixed. Most contacts in Boston cited higher sales or revenues than a year-ago but mixed results since the previous month. New York and Dallas described economic activity as flat, and Kansas City noted a modest decline in activity. Across the nation, business contacts were generally optimistic about future economic growth.  Consumer spending increased in the majority of Districts, although Kansas City and Dallas noted some weakness. Auto sales were mixed, but remained at elevated levels in most Districts. Tourism activity strengthened in most reporting Districts. Nonfinancial services activity grew slightly since the previous report, and demand for staffing services moved higher. Transportation activity was mixed, with weakness in the energy and agriculture sectors and lower export volumes limiting gains. Overall, manufacturing activity was flat, although conditions varied considerably across Districts. Most Districts noted that weak demand from the energy sector was creating a significant headwind for manufacturers, although contacts in San Francisco mentioned that low energy costs had reduced production costs for steel products. Many Districts reported that the strengthening dollar and weakening global outlook had negatively affected international exports. Residential real estate sales rose in most Districts since the last report, and home inventories were low in the majority of Districts. Residential construction activity strengthened, as several Districts noted strong growth in multifamily construction. Nonresidential real estate sales also picked up, on net, although sales ranged from flat to strong across all Districts. In the banking and finance sector, most Districts reported slight to modest increases in loan demand, stable credit quality and unchanged credit standards. Agricultural economic conditions were flat to down moderately, as low commodity prices and weak global demand continued to put downward pressure on farm income. The energy sector contracted further since the last report due to lower coal production and additional declines in the oil and gas industry. Labor market conditions continued to improve, with the majority of Districts reporting modest gains. Wage growth varied considerably, from flat to strong, across all Districts, and most Districts reported that consumer prices held steady. Consumer Spending and Tourism Consumer spending increased in the majority of Districts since the previous report, but some weakness was cited in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts. Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta and San Francisco reported that retail sales rose moderately, retailers in Chicago reported modest gains, and New York District retailers reported sales that were slightly higher than a year ago. Snowstorms temporarily slowed spending in the Philadelphia and Richmond Districts, but sales had bounced back. Retail contacts in the St. Louis District reported flat sales, while contacts in Minneapolis experienced mixed conditions. The Kansas City District reported a modest decline in retail sales since the previous reporting period, while Dallas reported that retail sales had softened. Contacts in Boston, Cleveland and Chicago noted that consumers seemed reluctant to spend, citing reluctance to add debt, financial market volatility, or economic uncertainty as significant factors limiting spending. There were mixed reports about the effects of lower gasoline prices on consumer spending, with contacts in Cleveland, Philadelphia, and St. Louis attributing some increased spending to lower gas prices and contacts from Boston and Chicago expressing disappointment about the extent to which lower gas prices were increasing other spending. Auto sales generally improved in the latest reporting period, but conditions varied significantly across Districts. Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco reported strong auto sales, and contacts in New York, Cleveland, and Minneapolis cited improved sales since the last report. Auto sales in the Philadelphia District were flat, and auto dealers in the Atlanta District noted a slow start to 2016. In the Kansas City, St. Louis, and Dallas Districts auto sales declined since the last report, and were below year-ago levels. Among those Districts reporting on tourism, most reported strengthening tourism activity. After a slow start to the ski season in parts of the country, contacts in the Philadelphia, Richmond, and Minneapolis Districts reported that skier visits had picked up. Lower gas prices contributed to increased visitors at local tourist attractions in the Atlanta District, and the Minneapolis District reported solid activity in the national parks. Tourism contacts in the San Francisco District cited additional gains since the last report and increased hotel profitability. Hospitality contacts in the Atlanta District reported solid advanced bookings for business and convention segments, but convention-related business activity was below expectations in the St. Louis District. Although tourism activity in the New York District was stable since the last reporting period, occupancy rates at New York City hotels remained below year-ago levels. Tourism activity declined moderately in the Kansas City District, although resort areas performed better. Nonfinancial Services Overall, nonfinancial services activity expanded slightly. Service sector firms in Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Dallas reported positive growth. Business services continued to expand at a modest pace in San Francisco, and the Kansas City District reported flat sales in professional and high-tech services. Service sector firms in the New York District noted that business had softened, and revenues at services firms in the Richmond District weakened. Strength was noted in the healthcare and social assistance, leisure and hospitality and business support services sectors in the St. Louis District; Minneapolis reported strength in design services and utilities; and Dallas noted strength in real estate and medical services. Demand for healthcare services was unchanged in the St. Louis District, but softened somewhat in the San Francisco District. Demand for staffing services moved generally higher, with staffing services contacts reporting increased activity in Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Cleveland. However, the Chicago and Dallas Districts noted that demand for staffing firms was flat, with the Dallas District noting weakness in the Houston area due to the effects of low oil prices. Transportation activity varied, with demand weighed down by weakness in the energy and agriculture sectors and lower export volumes. Port contacts in the Richmond and Atlanta Districts noted increased volumes, despite soft export activity and fewer imports of farm machinery in the Richmond District. The trucking industry reported plans to expand services in the St. Louis District. Several Districts noted a decline in rail cargo, including Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas, with Minneapolis attributing this decline to drops in oil and coal freight. Weakness in the energy sector had also led to reduced volumes of barges hauling liquid petroleum in the St. Louis District. Freight volumes contracted further in the Cleveland District, while contacts in the Kansas City District reported a moderate decline in transportation activity. Manufacturing Conditions in the manufacturing sector continued to be mixed across Districts since the previous reporting period. Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis and San Francisco indicated flat to moderate growth in overall activity, whereas New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Kansas City and Dallas reported slight to moderate declines. Manufacturing contacts in Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco reported significant headwinds due to weak demand from the energy sector, although contacts in San Francisco noted that low energy costs had reduced production costs for steel products. Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Dallas, and San Francisco noted that the strengthening dollar and weakening global outlook had negatively affected international exports. Continued sluggishness in the agriculture industry was cited as a headwind for the manufacturing sector in Chicago and Kansas City. Contacts in the auto and aerospace industries in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts reported positive growth, with auto production in Cleveland District assembly plants in 2015 on par with 2014 and near historically-high levels. However, a manufacturer of auto and aerospace parts in Boston noted continued decline of overall activity. Expectations for future growth in the manufacturing sector were positive over the coming months for Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Kansas City. Boston also reported a positive outlook for the manufacturing sector, with the exception of the auto and aerospace industries. Contacts in Cleveland and Dallas reported mixed outlooks, with concern specifically over chemical producers and contacts who sell strictly to industrial plants, respectively. Real Estate and Construction Residential real estate sales were up since the last report across all Districts, with the exception of New York and Kansas City where sales were somewhat weaker in part due to normal seasonal patterns. The Boston, Cleveland, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts reported strong growth in sales, and contacts in Boston and Cleveland cited relatively mild winter weather as a positive contribution to growth. Low- to moderately-priced homes sold better than higher-priced homes in Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas. Condo sales increased across the Boston and Cleveland Districts but slowed somewhat in New York City. New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City reported low residential real estate inventories, and contacts in the Boston District reported that inventory of both single-family homes and condos were below year-ago levels. Residential real estate prices increased in the Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts, while New York and Philadelphia reported little or no increase in house prices. Residential construction generally strengthened since the previous survey period, with only Philadelphia and Kansas City reporting declines. Contacts from the New York District reported sluggish single-family construction but robust multifamily construction. Boston, Richmond, and San Francisco also reported strong growth in multifamily construction, and St. Louis noted an increase in speculative multifamily construction projects. Districts characterized nonresidential real estate sales and leasing growth as flat to strong. Contacts in Cleveland cited growth in demand from the healthcare and higher education sectors and to a lesser extent the manufacturing, commercial real estate (excluding office buildings) and multifamily housing sectors. Commercial occupancy rates rose in San Francisco, spurring higher lease rates and additional construction projects. Commercial vacancy rates were nearing or below prerecession levels in Minneapolis despite significant new commercial real estate construction, and St. Paul saw more commercial net absorption in the last year than in the previous ten years combined. Similarly, industrial vacancy rates decreased across the Cleveland, St. Louis, and Dallas Districts. Demand for commercial real estate space grew robustly in Chicago across retail, industrial and office segments, but there was concern that the lack of commercial construction and increased demand would lead to space shortages and price bubbles. Commercial leasing activity in Boston was steady, and fundamentals remained strong. Richmond commercial leasing activity increased moderately for the retail market since the previous report, while activity in the office and industrial markets was tepid. Commercial rents increased in Philadelphia, and contacts in Atlanta noted generally improving rents as well as increased absorption. With respect to nonresidential construction, the New York District reported that availability rates and asking rents held steady for office space, but that new office construction had weakened further. Commercial construction continued to expand at a robust pace in Minneapolis, but industrial construction slowed in the Chicago District. Banking and Finance Loan demand increased in most Districts, although New York and Kansas City reported mixed or steady demand and Philadelphia experienced a slight decline. St. Louis reported strong demand for mortgages and commercial and industrial loans, while demand for consumer loans remained unchanged.  Banks in the Atlanta District reported healthy pipelines in residential lending and increased mortgage refinancing. New York reported mixed loan demand at small-to-medium-sized banks including weakening demand for consumer loans and residential mortgages but rising demand for commercial loans. While lending grew in most categories in Dallas, contacts indicated that low oil prices continued to suppress demand. Contacts in Chicago noted that concerns about slower global economic growth had led to declines in equity markets, wider spreads for asset-backed securities, and an increase in financial market uncertainty, and in Dallas, financial market and monetary policy uncertainty had created concerns about 2016 growth prospects. Credit quality was stable for most Districts. Improved loan quality was noted in Philadelphia, Richmond, and San Francisco. However, in the San Francisco District, it was noted that low commodity prices could undermine asset quality in the agricultural sector in the months ahead. In St. Louis, loan delinquencies were unchanged to slightly lower in all loan categories, but creditworthiness of applicants improved. Credit standards remained the same for most Districts. In Philadelphia, some contacts noted a tightening of standards, especially for energy-related industries. In St. Louis, credit standards were unchanged to somewhat tighter for all loan categories. Loan pricing was competitive in Atlanta and Chicago. Banking contacts in Philadelphia indicated a competitive lending environment. Competition among banks intensified somewhat in recent weeks in the Richmond District. In San Francisco, lender competition for qualified borrowers was vigorous. Cleveland reported consumers increasingly turning to non-bank competitors for auto lending. Agriculture and Natural Resources Agricultural economic conditions were flat to moderately down in reporting Districts since the previous report. Low commodity prices and weak global demand continued to put downward pressure on farm income. Minneapolis reported weaker farm incomes and lower prices for all commodities except turkeys. Farmers in the Chicago District were adjusting to the dip in commodity prices by utilizing cheaper seed varieties and selling equipment. Kansas City reported weakening credit conditions and modest declines in farmland values amid tighter profit margins for crop and livestock producers. In the Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, agricultural exports slowed alongside the strengthening dollar. In agricultural production, Richmond reported limited activity due to typical seasonal slowdowns, while St. Louis reported an increase in red meat production compared with the previous year. Production conditions in the Dallas District improved from the previous year due to increased soil moisture, and most of the Atlanta District was drought free by mid-February. However, San Francisco farmers and ranchers continued to struggle with persistent drought, despite above-average winter rainfall. The energy sector contracted further since the last report, with most reporting Districts noting modest to moderate declines in activity. Coal production fell in the Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Districts. Several Districts reported additional declines in oil and gas drilling rigs including Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas. Weakness in the oil and gas sector led to announced or anticipated capital spending cutbacks in Minneapolis, Kansas City and Dallas. Cleveland and Atlanta reported layoffs in the energy sector, and the Kansas City District expected additional layoffs in the coming months. Energy contacts in Kansas City commented that financial borrowing bases were being reduced, and the Dallas District indicated that the financial positions of many firms continued to deteriorate. Refinery demand along the Gulf Coast remained steady and was doing well in the Cleveland District, and an oil refinery in the Minneapolis District announced plans for large capital upgrades over the next three years. Employment, Wages, and Prices Labor market conditions continued to strengthen since the previous reporting period, with the majority of Districts reporting modest growth in the labor market. However, labor conditions were mixed in Atlanta and Dallas, and Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco noted decreased employment in the energy sector. Contacts in New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City reported difficulty in finding skilled workers including information technology, engineering, specialty healthcare, construction, manufacturing, and transportation employees. Contacts in Cleveland and Richmond noted that low-skilled positions were becoming increasingly difficult to fill, but contacts in Atlanta reported that low- to mid-skilled positions were easier to fill. Retail employment was down slightly in Dallas due to weak sales, while Kansas City contacts reported a shortage of available retail salespeople. Wages generally increased, as most Districts experienced slight to strong wage growth. However, the Kansas City, Richmond and Atlanta Districts reported flat wage growth. St. Louis noted strong wage growth as fifty-six percent of contacts, the highest in two years, reported that wages were above year-ago levels. Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco reported positive wage growth among high-skilled workers, especially for occupations in the technology, high-skilled manufacturing, aerospace and defense, financial services, and professional technical sectors. Furthermore, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City reported wage growth among low-skill and entry-level positions. A contact in Chicago attributed the rise of entry-level wages in Michigan to an increase in the minimum wage. Staffing firms in the Boston District reported single-digit wage increases, but staffing services contacts in Dallas cited easing wage pressures, especially in Houston. Wage pressures moderated in the service sector in Richmond but continued upward pressure was cited in New York. Wages in the retail sector declined in the Kansas City District but increased in Cleveland. Overall, prices were generally flat since the previous survey period. Contacts in Chicago noted rising auto costs, and contacts in the San Francisco District experienced increased prices in the pharmaceutical and construction sectors. Despite overall flat prices across the Dallas District, an increasing amount of deflationary pressure was reported. Manufacturers' finished goods prices held steady in Cleveland but declined in Kansas City. Retailers in Kansas City and Dallas noted a higher-than-average amount of promotional pricing and a decline in selling prices, respectively, but retail contacts in Chicago and San Francisco noted flat prices. Agriculture commodity prices were reported as lower in Boston, Atlanta, Kansas City and San Francisco. Several Districts noted lower oil, fuel and transportation costs. However, a Boston District contact in the semiconductor industry said reduced energy prices were not showing up as much as expected in the prices they paid.",2016-03-02
113,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and based on information collected on or before April 7, 2016. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.         Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that national economic activity continued to expand in late February and March, though the pace of growth varied across Districts. Most Districts said that economic growth was in the modest to moderate range and that contacts expected growth would remain in that range going forward. Consumer spending increased modestly in most Districts and reports on tourism were mostly positive. Labor market conditions continued to strengthen and business spending generally expanded across most Districts. Demand for nonfinancial services grew moderately overall. Manufacturing activity increased in most Districts. Construction and real estate activity also expanded. Credit conditions improved, on net, in most Districts. Low prices weighed on energy and mining output as well as prospects for agricultural producers. Overall, prices increased modestly across the majority of Districts, and input cost pressures continued to ease.           Consumer Spending and Tourism Consumer spending in most Districts increased modestly in late February and March, and retailers generally remained optimistic about the outlook for growth over the remainder of the year. Several Districts cited the continuation of generous discounts and promotions, favorable credit conditions, and low gasoline prices as factors supporting a steady pace of growth in consumer spending. However, contacts in the Chicago District again expressed disappointment that low gas prices and improving labor markets were not providing more of a boost to consumer spending. The Kansas City, Philadelphia, Richmond, and San Francisco Districts reported increases in spending on nondurable goods and services, while some Districts noted higher sales in select categories of durable goods, such as furniture. Auto sales remained strong in several Districts, and the Cleveland, Chicago, and New York Districts reported that leasing activity increased.             Reports on tourism were mostly positive across the Districts, and contacts were largely optimistic about near term prospects. Business and leisure travel remained strong in Atlanta, while business travel was up in Boston and leisure travel was up in Chicago and Richmond. Hoteliers in the Richmond District reported both a strong close to the winter season and a strong start to the spring season. In addition, ski resorts in the Kansas City District reported robust activity. In contrast, contacts in the Atlanta, Boston, Minneapolis, and New York Districts noted fewer international visitors.       Hiring and Business Spending Labor market conditions continued to strengthen in late February and March. Most Districts again reported job gains, with only Cleveland indicating a decline in overall employment. Service industry employment rose in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, and Dallas. Retail payrolls expanded in Richmond, but declined in Dallas. Growth in employment at financial firms was subdued in New York and employment declined in Cleveland. Manufacturing payrolls rose in Boston, Richmond, and Atlanta, but fell in Philadelphia and Cleveland. Energy companies continued to reduce their workforces, with reports of layoffs coming from Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas. Several Districts indicated that contacts had difficulty filling certain positions in a number of low- and high-skilled occupations. Notably, contacts reported difficulty finding quality retail workers (Boston), low-skilled manufacturing workers (Boston and Chicago), construction workers (Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco) and skilled professionals in occupations such as information technology, accounting, engineering, and customer service (Richmond and Atlanta).             Business spending generally expanded across most Districts. Districts reporting on inventories indicated that they generally were in line with sales. Retailers in Boston, New York, and Chicago said that inventories for most items were at desirable levels, though contacts in New York, Chicago, and Dallas noted that the mild weather resulted in excess stocks of winter-related items. Manufacturers in Boston and Chicago said inventories were comfortable, while manufacturers in Atlanta said they were somewhat elevated. Capital spending increased on balance in most Districts, with scattered reports of spending for capacity expansion. Retailers in Boston and San Francisco were spending for replacement, and some contacts in Boston were aggressively expanding capacity. Manufacturers in several Districts reported increases in capital outlays (Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis). Capital spending remained modest for manufacturers in San Francisco and for refiners in Dallas, and declined further for manufacturers in Kansas City. Outlays for oil and gas extraction were mixed. Contacts in Cleveland reported ongoing expansion (though at a slower pace), while there was little growth in Atlanta and Dallas, and declines in Kansas City. District reports mentioned a variety of other sectors where capital investment had expanded: tourism (Philadelphia and Atlanta), construction and finance (Cleveland), professional, high-tech, and wholesale trade (Kansas City), and pharmaceuticals (San Francisco). In contrast, capital spending by transportation contacts declined in Cleveland and Kansas City.       Nonfinancial Services Growth in demand for nonfinancial services picked up to a moderate rate and contacts expected this pace of growth to continue. Several Districts reported increases in demand for professional and business services. Contacts in the Boston, Kansas City, and Minneapolis Districts reported moderate increases in demand for information technology, architecture, or legal services and the Boston District reported some growth in demand for consulting. Activity in the health care sector grew at a solid pace in a number of Districts. Contacts in the San Francisco District reported robust demand for health care services (resulting in capacity shortages at some facilities) and contacts in the Richmond District reported a late surge in demand for healthcare services because of a flu and norovirus outbreak. Results were also mostly positive for staffing firms. Transportation activity rose moderately, with several Districts reporting increases in freight volumes. Port contacts in the Richmond District cited record import volumes in February that moderated in March, as well as a modest rise in exports in part because of stronger shipments of agricultural and forest products. San Francisco noted an increase in cargo volumes. Kansas City indicated that transportation and wholesale trade activity had increased sharply, and the Atlanta and Richmond Districts cited notable increases in truck tonnage. In contrast, the Atlanta and Dallas Districts each reported additional decreases in rail cargo, and contacts in the Cleveland and Dallas Districts said that ongoing softness in the energy and steel sectors continued to weigh on freight volumes.       Manufacturing Manufacturing activity increased in most Districts in late February and March. Contacts described the overall pace of growth as moderate in Richmond and Chicago, while growth was more modest in Philadelphia, St. Louis, and San Francisco. Only Cleveland and Kansas City reported declines in activity. By industry, district reports indicated that the strongest performers were autos (Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas), aerospace (Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago), and computers and electronics (Boston and Dallas). There also were solid gains in construction materials (Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago), food processing (Richmond and Dallas), defense (Chicago), and pharmaceuticals (San Francisco). Results were mixed for producers of paper products, metals, and chemicals. Demand was weak according to plastics manufacturers in Richmond and Kansas City. Demand for steel changed little according to contacts in Cleveland and Chicago, but declined in Kansas City. Several Districts reported weak overall demand for heavy machinery, with Chicago and Minneapolis noting softer demand for agricultural and mining machinery than for construction machinery. Suppliers for the oil and gas industry consistently reported weak demand (Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas), and some contacts in Chicago and Dallas indicated they were trying to adjust their product offerings toward other industries. Expectations for future manufacturing growth were mixed. In general, contacts' outlooks were optimistic in Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Richmond, but pessimistic in Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas.       Construction and Real Estate Construction and real estate activity generally expanded in late February and March, and contacts across Districts maintained a positive outlook for the rest of the year. Residential real estate activity strengthened, on balance, with robust growth in San Francisco, Cleveland, and Boston, but more mixed reports from Dallas, Kansas City, and Atlanta. Several Districts credited a mild winter for stronger home sales, and the pace of home price increases picked up in a number of Districts. Multi-family construction remained strong in most Districts. Chicago, Cleveland, and St. Louis also noted some improvement in demand for single-family home construction, and a contact in San Francisco reported backlogs of more than six months for new single-family units. Commercial real estate activity generally increased, with leasing activity and rents rising in many Districts: particularly strong leasing was noted in retailing in Chicago and in the industrial sector in Dallas. Vacancy rates either moved lower or were unchanged in most Districts. Most Districts reporting on nonresidential construction said that demand increased. Contacts in Boston said the education, health care, hospitality, retail, and office sectors all contributed to its recent construction boom. Nonresidential contractors in Cleveland cited broad-based demand, with particular strength in education and healthcare projects, where several builders expressed concern about their capacity to take on additional projects. In contrast, Chicago noted continued weak demand for industrial construction, and Philadelphia reported fewer starts of new nonresidential projects.       Banking and Finance Credit conditions improved, on net, in most Districts, with the exception of Dallas where contacts indicated that the lending outlook remained cautious. Overall, the lending environment remained competitive. Contacts in Richmond said that competition continued to intensify with reports of compression on net interest margins along with an ongoing trend toward bank consolidation. San Francisco said vigorous competition for borrowers was holding down profit margins for some institutions. Boston described the commercial real estate environment as particularly competitive. Business lending grew across several Districts. Commercial and industrial loan demand continued to increase in New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Cleveland. A majority of Districts also noted continued growth in lending for commercial real estate, though Cleveland indicated that the pace of growth had slowed. For consumer lending, New York, Cleveland, and San Francisco all reported increased demand for residential mortgages, while Dallas indicated that growth in mortgage loan volumes had slowed. San Francisco also reported strong growth for revolving credit, and Chicago indicated that credit card utilization rates increased. The Chicago and Philadelphia Districts also cited a pickup in auto loan demand. Reports on changes in credit quality were mixed. Philadelphia and Atlanta noted improvements in credit quality, and Cleveland, New York and Dallas reported that delinquency rates remain low. In contrast, contacts in Dallas said that loan quality continued to mildly deteriorate because of ongoing stress in the energy sector, while contacts in Atlanta said that financial institutions in areas dependent on energy faced continued risk, with some adding to loan loss reserves.       Agriculture and Natural Resources Agricultural conditions were mixed across the Districts. Contacts in Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas reported poor prospects for agricultural profitability because product prices remained low and input costs remained relatively high. Contacts across Districts noted that compared with a year ago, prices were lower for cotton, corn, soybeans, wheat, hay, rice, cattle, chickens, eggs, hogs, and milk. However, contacts also reported some relief in input costs since the previous period, with lower costs for diesel, fertilizer, and farmland rents. That said, costs for chemicals went up and seed costs remained elevated. There were typical seasonal increases in fieldwork in Richmond and Chicago. Earlier flooding made fieldwork more difficult in parts of the Richmond and Atlanta Districts, but harm from flooding in St. Louis was limited. San Francisco reported improved agricultural activity as ample rains enhanced growing conditions and reduced the impacts of the ongoing drought in California. Contacts in Dallas said beef production was higher than a year ago. The elevated dollar held back agricultural exports according to contacts in San Francisco.             Natural resource reports ranged from mixed to negative across Districts. Oil and gas production continued to fall in Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas, though contacts in some Districts reported signs that the declines were close to an end. Contacts in Cleveland and Atlanta noted that natural gas prices were under pressure because the warm winter left inventories elevated. Cleveland and Dallas reported that persistently low energy prices were hurting the financial positions of energy firms. Coal output declined in Richmond and St. Louis. In contrast, some idled iron mines in Minneapolis reported plans to reopen soon. San Francisco contacts reported solid domestic timber demand but those in Minneapolis indicated that the warm winter slowed logging activity.       Prices and Wages Retail prices increased modestly across the majority of the Districts while input cost pressures continued to decline in late February and March, driven importantly by low energy prices. Transportation costs fell, as freight companies passed lower fuel costs through to shipping rates. The Cleveland District reported that diesel fuel surcharges have been largely eliminated. Residential construction contacts in the Philadelphia and Cleveland Districts reported that low energy prices have significantly reduced costs for petroleum-based materials such as shingles. Contacts in San Francisco said that lower fuel prices have improved airline profit margins. Several District reports indicated that contacts generally expect energy and raw material prices to remain at low levels, though a manufacturer in the Minneapolis District expected steel prices to increase later this year.             Wages increased in all but one District (Atlanta), and several Districts reported signs of a pickup in wage growth over the last survey period. New York, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco reported moderate wage growth, while wage pressures were characterized as mild in Chicago, mostly contained in Kansas City, and stable in Atlanta. The strongest wage pressures were for occupations where labor shortages are pressing and turnover is elevated. Contacts in the Boston, Cleveland, and St. Louis Districts cited sizeable wage increases for workers in fields such as information technology services and skilled construction and manufacturing trades. In addition, some firms in Philadelphia indicated that they had raised their starting wages in order to attract higher quality workers, and Chicago noted an increase in the number of contacts who raised wages for low-skilled entry-level workers.",2016-04-13
114,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and based on information collected before May 23, 2016. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.    Information received from the 12 Federal Reserve Districts mostly described modest economic growth since the last Beige Book report. Economic activity in April through mid-May increased at a moderate pace in the San Francisco District, while modest growth was reported by Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis. Chicago noted that the pace of growth slowed, as did Kansas City. Dallas reported that economic activity grew marginally, while New York characterized activity as generally flat since the last report. Several Districts noted that contacts had generally optimistic outlooks, with firms expecting growth either to continue at its current pace or to increase.  Consumer spending was up modestly on balance in many Districts, though contacts in the Boston, Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts reported mixed or flat activity, and New York reported weakened sales. Many Districts reported modest growth in nonfinancial services. Manufacturing activity was mixed across Districts. Construction and real estate activity generally expanded since the last report, and the overall outlook among contacts in these industries remained positive. Overall loan demand was up moderately in all but one of the Districts that reported it, and many Districts reported steady to good credit availability. Crop conditions were promising in many Districts, but low commodity prices continued to put pressure on agricultural incomes. The energy sector remained weak. Employment grew modestly since the last report, but tight labor markets were widely noted; wages grew modestly, and price pressure grew slightly in most Districts. Consumer Spending and Tourism Consumer spending and tourism activity was up modestly in many Districts, though contacts in the Boston, Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts reported mixed or flat activity. With respect to retail sales, only the New York District reported weakened sales in April and early May. The Boston, New York, and Philadelphia Districts indicated that cool spring weather dampened sales relative to the same time last year. Retailers across many Districts reported increased competition from online sales, citing a shift in consumer preferences away from in-store shopping. Luxury and premium product sales were notably subdued in the Richmond, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts since the last report. The tourism and hospitality sectors saw mixed activity in New York and Minneapolis, while Philadelphia, Kansas City, and San Francisco experienced improved activity. Contacts in the Atlanta, Richmond, and St. Louis Districts indicated that hotel and hospitality bookings were higher than a year earlier. Among Districts that reported new and used auto sales activity, sales were steady in April and May, with the exception of Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Kansas City, where a slight decline was reported. Dealers in the Chicago District reported a rise in new and used light vehicle sales. But overall, truck and large vehicle sales outpaced auto sales across many Districts. In Cleveland, motor vehicle sales grew 1 percent over a year ago, with light trucks and SUVs dominating purchases. Dealers in the Richmond District reported that light truck sales were especially strong. Luxury vehicle sales were mixed; Cleveland reported weakened demand, whereas Chicago reported a shift upward in demand. Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Dallas reported an optimistic outlook for annual auto sales in 2016, due mostly to low gas prices. Nonfinancial Services Since the previous report, many Districts, including New York, Richmond, St. Louis, and Minneapolis, reported modest growth across many nonfinancial services, whereas San Francisco indicated that growth was moderate. Philadelphia indicated no significant change in the modest pace of growth since the last report, characterizing the services economy as ""disappointingly stable,"" according to a contact. New York contacts noted a steady rise in activity in April and early May. The Minneapolis, Kansas, and Dallas Districts reported an expansion in the technology and professional services sectors. Minneapolis and Dallas also reported expansion in the health care sector. Boston District contacts in the staffing services sector characterized activity as strong. In contrast, contacts in the Cleveland District reported that transportation services declined, with railroad activity down by as much as 35 percent from the same time last year. The Kansas City District also reported declines in transportation-related activity and capital spending. The Richmond District characterized transportation services, such as trucking and airport activity (both passenger and cargo), as ""uneven"" and ""flat to slightly stronger."" Contacts in both the Richmond and St. Louis Districts reported optimism for the coming months for some nonfinancial services sectors. Manufacturing Manufacturing activity was mixed across Districts in April through mid-May. Richmond reported that activity increased on balance, and Atlanta noted that it remained strong. Reports indicated a modest increase in manufacturing output in Cleveland, Chicago, and Minneapolis, and the manufacturing sector in Dallas grew slightly. Activity was flat in San Francisco and fell in New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Kansas City. The outlook for manufacturing improved since the last report in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City; outlooks in Boston and St. Louis were also positive. District reports portrayed mixed growth across industries within manufacturing. Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Minneapolis noted increased demand for construction materials or equipment, but Dallas reported that among construction-related manufacturers, demand was mixed over the reporting period and slightly down from a year earlier. Metal manufacturers in the Richmond District indicated that new orders had risen, Chicago reported growth in steel demand, and producers in Cleveland were encouraged by an increase in domestic steel prices but reported little change in demand. San Francisco noted that steel producers benefited from reduced overseas competition, but contacts reported somewhat weak demand for other manufactured metals. Philadelphia and Dallas also cited weakness in primary metals. Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas reported weakness tied to reduced demand from the energy sector. Construction and Real Estate Construction and real estate activity generally expanded since the last report, and the overall outlook among contacts remained positive. Commercial construction activity increased in Philadelphia, Richmond, and Minneapolis. Strong project pipelines were reported in Cleveland, and some contractors in Atlanta noted one- to two-year backlogs. An uptick in industrial construction was cited in St. Louis, while activity was varied across markets in Boston. Residential construction increased in most Districts but was mixed in Richmond and Dallas, where some markets saw a decline in single-family construction. In Chicago, a slight increase in residential construction was concentrated in single-family and suburban markets. St. Louis contacts reported an uptick in residential construction, and many contacts expected a similar increase next quarter. Multifamily construction continued to grow in many Districts, including New York, St. Louis, and Dallas, but a slowing was noted in Atlanta. In San Francisco, construction of multifamily units continued to outpace single-family units. In Boston, apartment construction remained very active, but related lending slowed among smaller banks. Commercial real estate activity increased in most Districts that reported. Absorption of space increased in Atlanta and Kansas City, while Dallas reported healthy demand for office space. A decline in vacancy rates and a rise in rents were noted in Chicago and Minneapolis. Contacts in San Francisco said demand for commercial real estate expanded further, particularly in urban areas with robust technology and health care industries. Residential real estate activity increased moderately across most Districts. Home sales were strong in Boston, Cleveland, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Residential sales were positive but somewhat lower in other Districts. Sales for entry-level and other lower-priced homes were particularly strong, according to Chicago and Dallas contacts. Lower inventories of homes were reported by contacts in New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Minneapolis and have led to bidding wars in the Richmond District and constrained home sales in Philadelphia. Home prices were reported higher overall; Cleveland contacts said that home prices rose 3 percent year over year. In Philadelphia, home prices were mixed across markets and price categories.   Banking and Finance Overall loan demand was up moderately in all Districts that reported, with the exception of Dallas. Commercial and industrial loans were up in Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Contacts in the Atlanta District indicated that there was strong loan demand, except for the energy industry. In the Chicago District, business loan demand changed little from the previous report. Residential mortgage lending was up in the New York, Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts. The Dallas District reported that overall lending was mixed, whereas the Philadelphia District reported that mortgages and home equity loans were down since the prior reporting period. Bankers in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Dallas Districts reported seeing increased activity in auto lending. The St. Louis and San Francisco Districts reported improved credit quality. Contacts in the New York and Cleveland Districts reported lower delinquency rates on the consumer side. Banking contacts from the Atlanta District indicated an optimistic outlook for the remainder of the year. Agriculture and Natural Resources Crop conditions were promising in many Districts, but low commodity prices continued to put pressure on agricultural incomes. Favorable weather got the growing season off to a solid start in St. Louis and Minneapolis and improved production prospects in Dallas. However, wet, cool weather in the Chicago District put planting behind the pace of last spring, and rain delayed planting and harvesting of some crops in parts of the Richmond District. In contrast, parts of the Atlanta District were experiencing abnormally dry to moderate drought conditions. Though prices for some commodities such as soybeans and hogs have increased recently from their low points, most crop and animal product prices remained below their year-earlier levels. Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City noted that prices were below profitable levels for some producers. The energy sector remained weak since the previous Beige Book. Oil drilling continued to decrease in Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas. While natural gas drilling was little changed over this reporting period in Cleveland, demand was rising and output in that District remained at historic highs; natural gas extraction increased in Richmond since the previous report. Coal production was unchanged in Richmond, but fell in St. Louis and Kansas City. Contacts in Cleveland and Dallas expressed optimism that prices for natural gas and oil, respectively, may have bottomed out. Employment, Wages, and Prices Employment grew modestly since the last report, but tight labor markets were widely noted in most Districts. Demand for labor rose moderately in Richmond, and contacts noted continued difficulty finding workers in numerous occupations. In Boston, staffing industry contacts observed robust labor demand, particularly for specialized workers in high-skill fields. Contacts in Atlanta and Richmond said high-skill workers in high-demand fields continued to be hard to find, and low-skill jobs were also becoming harder to fill. In St. Louis, contacts that reported having trouble filling job vacancies primarily cited few applicants or candidates lacking the necessary skills. In New York, employment grew modestly, and manufacturing and services firms planned to add jobs in the months ahead. Soft labor markets were reported in energy sectors in Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas. Wages grew modestly since the last report, with increases concentrated in areas of labor tightness. Higher wages were reported for entry-level and lower-skill positions in Richmond and Atlanta. In San Francisco, minimum wage increases pushed up wages for low-skilled workers, with diminishing effects up the pay scale. Atlanta, St. Louis, and San Francisco reported wage pressure for certain high-skilled employees. In New York, a sizable share of service-sector contacts reported higher wages. In St. Louis, more than two-thirds of hiring managers reported increasing wages and salaries by more than they had in the past few years to retain employees and attract new ones. However, in Kansas City, contacts in several industries reported only slight increases in wages and expected similar increases going forward. Wage pressure was minimal in the Dallas District, due in part to compensation at energy services firms that was steady to lower for staff that have been retained. Price pressure grew slightly in most Districts. Multiple Districts noted small price increases in building materials, including concrete and steel. Contacts in Cleveland reported higher construction prices to cover rising worker costs resulting from tight labor markets. The majority of contacts in Philadelphia reported no significant change in input costs or customer prices. In New York, contacts in manufacturing and services cited little change in selling prices but moderate upward pressure in costs. In Kansas City, retail prices rose moderately and were expected to increase further. In San Francisco, growing competition from expanding online retailers held down price growth for most retail grocery products; apparel contacts there also reported significant price discounting. The outlook for prices was moderate; survey respondents in Philadelphia and Atlanta expected inflation of about 2 percent over the coming year.",2016-06-01

New York, however, described its tourism activity as generally sluggish, and hospitality contacts in San Francisco reported lower occupancy rates. In contrast, strong growth in tourism activity was reported in Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City. Manufacturing and Other Business Activity Manufacturing activity was mixed since the previous report. The reporting Districts noted that the outlook remained positive but deteriorated. Activity declined in Richmond and Dallas, remained unchanged in Cleveland and San Francisco, and increased in Boston and Atlanta, but at a slower pace than previously reported. Activity continued to increase at a modest pace in Chicago and Minneapolis. Several Districts reported a rebound following a decline in the previous reporting period, including New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Several Districts reported strength in aircraft and automobile manufacturing, although contacts in Cleveland noted that year-to-date production of automobiles is lower than at this time last year. Conditions in the primary metals industry were mixed: Contacts in Philadelphia and Dallas reported declines in new orders and weaker activity, while contacts in Cleveland and Chicago reported an increase in demand for steel. In Boston, Chicago, and Minneapolis, manufacturers with ties to the energy sector reported weakness. Growth in the nonfinancial services sector was described as slight to modest by reporting Districts.

Reports from the technology sector were mixed, with contacts in San Francisco reporting slower sales, contacts in Kansas City reporting modest increases in activity, and contacts in Boston reporting robust growth. Conditions in the transportation sector were mixed. Overall freight volume was down in Cleveland, and reports from Chicago indicate a decline in demand for transportation services. Contacts in Atlanta and Dallas noted a decrease in rail cargo volume. In contrast, container volume increased at ports in the Richmond and Atlanta Districts. Contacts in Cleveland, Atlanta, and St. Louis cited the slowdown in the energy sector as a contributor to low cargo volume. Real Estate and Construction Residential real estate activity continued to strengthen since the previous period. Single-family home sales increased at a moderate pace overall, with Boston, Cleveland, and St. Louis reporting strong growth. Many Districts indicated that inventories continue to be low. Despite this persistent inventory issue, Boston, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas all report that contacts have a positive outlook for the market in the next few months. Districts generally reported that house prices increased. Residential construction activity was mostly positive across Districts. Cleveland and Kansas City indicated strong growth in housing starts. Conversely, New York reported that single-family construction tapered off through most of the District, and Chicago reported little change in residential construction activity. Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco noted a lack of available lots to build on. Commercial sales and leasing activity remained stable or improved in almost all Districts.

Reports from Chicago were mixed while loan growth softened in Dallas. Residential lending increased variedly in all reporting Districts, from anemic expansion in Dallas to strong growth in St. Louis. Loan demand for commercial and industrial loans was mixed across reporting Districts, ranging from declining growth in Dallas to strong growth in St. Louis. Demand increased for commercial real estate loans in New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, and Kansas City and plateaued in Dallas. Consumer lending was unchanged or improved in all reporting Districts, except for declines in auto lending in Cleveland and revolving credit in San Francisco. Asset quality improved across reporting Districts, except in Chicago and Kansas City where it was mostly unchanged. Lending standards were unchanged in New York, Cleveland, and Kansas City. Dallas reported relaxed standards for all sectors except energy. Agriculture and Natural Resources Agricultural activity was mixed but improving on average. Most reporting Districts noted higher prices for their respective major crops at the time farmers were able to lock-in for the fall harvest, while Cleveland, Richmond, and Chicago reported that some crop prices have declined recently. Planting for key crops compared favorably with historical progress in reporting Districts. Most reporting Districts noted that growing conditions are currently good, but Richmond reported flood damage in West Virginia and Atlanta reported varying degrees of drought. Farm income is expected to improve from very low levels in Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas. Livestock prices were mixed in the reporting Districts. Energy firm downsizing or weak growth was reported by contacts in Cleveland, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas; however, the outlook for oil and gas is improving in Kansas City and Dallas. Dallas and Atlanta noted that credit availability is a major downside risk for the outlook. The number of operating drilling rigs declined in Kansas City, was unchanged in Cleveland, and increased in Minneapolis and Dallas; natural gas extraction growth was flat in Richmond. A continued, severe decline in coal production was reported in St. Louis, while Richmond reported no change in production.",2016-07-13
116,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and based on information collected on or before August 29, 2016. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.   Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that national economic activity continued to expand at a modest pace on balance during the reporting period of July through late August. Most Districts reported a ""modest"" or ""moderate"" pace of overall growth. However, Kansas City and New York reported no change in activity, and Philadelphia and Richmond noted that, while still expanding, activity slowed from the previous period. Contacts across the twelve Districts generally expect moderate economic growth in coming months. Overall consumer spending was little changed in most Districts, and auto sales declined somewhat but remained at high levels. Tourism activity was flat from the previous report but above year-earlier levels. Sales of nonfinancial services gained further momentum. Manufacturing activity rose slightly in most Districts. Activity in residential real estate markets grew at a moderate pace, but the pace of sales was constrained in a few Districts by shortages of available homes. Commercial real estate activity expanded further. Demand for business and consumer credit varied across Districts but appeared to expand at a moderate pace overall, with stable credit quality. Agricultural conditions were mixed, with price declines largely offsetting growing volumes. Overall demand for energy-related products and services weakened.  Labor market conditions remained tight in most Districts, with moderate payroll growth noted in general. Upward wage pressures increased further and were moderate on balance, with more rapid gains reported for workers with selected specialized skill sets. Price increases remained slight overall. Consumer Spending and Tourism Retail sales volumes appeared little changed since the prior reporting period, although the Boston, Cleveland, and San Francisco Districts suggested modest gains on balance. Respondents in Boston reported a pickup in retail sales due in part to increased customer traffic, while contacts in the Philadelphia District reported that decreased foot traffic did not reduce sales volumes. Retail sales declined in the Dallas and Kansas City Districts, and Chicago reported that consumer spending ""slowed notably."" Sales ""softened"" according to Richmond and Atlanta, but contacts in the latter District expect the usual seasonal boost in sales during the Labor Day weekend. Inventory levels were in line with retailer expectations in the Boston, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, but higher than desired in the Chicago District. The pace of auto sales declined somewhat but remained at high levels in general. The Atlanta, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, and San Francisco Districts all noted a slowdown or reduction in sales, with New York pointing to a reduction in dealer incentives as a factor. Only Dallas reported strong growth in auto sales. Vehicle sales in the Philadelphia District were unchanged from last period, and contacts reported narrower profit margins. Inventory levels varied across Districts, with dealers in St. Louis reporting an elevated level, while dealers in Richmond kept inventories of new vehicles tight. Tourism activity was mostly flat relative to the prior reporting period, although the reports suggested that it was above year-earlier levels. Contacts in Chicago reported that the tourism industry continued to perform well, and demand for air travel in the San Francisco District remained strong. Demand for hotel rooms ticked down in Dallas, St. Louis, and New York. The elevated dollar did not slow international arrivals in Boston but did slow tourism activity in Minneapolis and San Francisco. Contacts in the Atlanta District also observed fewer international arrivals relative to the previous reporting period and were monitoring the potential impact of the Zika virus on international travel. Nonfinancial Services The pace of demand growth for nonfinancial services picked up slightly from the prior reporting period, and contacts generally expect moderate growth to continue in the sector. Only the New York District reported a broad decline in demand for services. Contacts in Richmond reported that demand for health-care services remained strong, particularly for outpatient care. Demand for restaurant services increased in Dallas and Kansas City. Activity in the information technology industry expanded in Minneapolis and St. Louis, and contacts in the Kansas City District expect moderate growth in that sector to continue over the coming months. Freight volumes picked up in Philadelphia, Richmond, and San Francisco but declined in Cleveland, Dallas, and St. Louis. Staffing services businesses in most Districts reported a moderate increase in activity, with Boston contacts reporting revenue increases of 3 to 30 percent over last year. By contrast Philadelphia reported slower growth in staffing demand since the prior reporting period. Transportation firms in the Atlanta District reported mixed results, with contacts in the rail industry reporting no change in volumes, but port contacts noting a year-over-year increase in shipping volumes. Manufacturing Activity in the manufacturing sector was flat to slightly up in general, with Chicago in particular reporting a moderate pace of growth. Activity in technology manufacturing was up modestly in Dallas, but contacts in San Francisco noted that production of semiconductors was flat and that capacity remained somewhat underutilized. Several transportation equipment and industrial machinery manufacturers reported plans to expand facilities in the St. Louis District. Pharmaceutical manufacturers in the San Francisco District reported that sales continued at a strong pace despite increased regulatory burdens and negative media coverage around industry pricing decisions. Weakness in the oil and gas extraction sector combined with competitive foreign supply to depress demand and production of steel products in several Districts. In contrast, contacts in the Chicago District noted that demand for steel was steady and declining imports have helped domestic producers gain market share. Manufacturers in Richmond are optimistic about growth prospects, and contacts in Philadelphia expect growth to pick up over the next six months. Real Estate and Construction Activity in residential real estate markets expanded further in most Districts. Growth in residential construction activity was moderate across many Districts but robust in San Francisco, where contacts reported that contractors are bumping up against capacity constraints for new projects. In Minneapolis, strong growth in the construction of single-family units was offset somewhat by a slowdown in the construction of multifamily units. Contacts in Dallas reported that demand for low- to mid-priced homes remained strong, while demand for higher priced homes softened in Dallas and New York, and was flat in Chicago. By contrast, sales in Cleveland were equally skewed toward the entry-level and high-end segments of the market. Boston, Richmond, Philadelphia, and St. Louis noted that home sales slowed in some areas of their Districts due to shortages of available units. Recent house price appreciation was reported to be modest in general. Contacts in several Districts were optimistic about future growth prospects, except in Kansas City, where respondents expect further declines in sales and inventories in the months ahead. Commercial real estate activity expanded further in most Districts. Construction and sales rose only slightly in Boston, Kansas City, and St. Louis but grew at a faster clip in Cleveland and Dallas. In the Atlanta District, construction activity expanded moderately, but contractors reported tight supply conditions, with construction backlogs of one to two years. Contacts in Richmond and New York noted strong growth in industrial construction, and vacancy rates for industrial space fell to 10-year lows in the latter District. Commercial leasing activity strengthened in New York, Richmond, and San Francisco, but grew at a softer pace in Philadelphia, where contacts described the market as in a ""lull, not a retreat."" Vacancy rates on commercial properties increased along with completions in the Kansas City District. Commercial rents edged up in various Districts, including in Dallas and San Francisco. Contacts in several Districts cited only modest expectations for sales and construction activity moving forward, due in part to economic uncertainty surrounding the November elections. Banking and Finance Demand for business and consumer credit varied widely but grew at moderate pace overall. Bankers in San Francisco reported strong demand for loans, while demand for loans in Dallas remained soft. Commercial and industrial lending activity slowed in some Districts, but Philadelphia reported that most loan categories grew at a faster pace than in the previous report. Small to medium-sized banks in the New York District noted strong demand across all loan categories. According to the Dallas and Kansas City Districts, some oil and gas companies reported challenges obtaining credit. Credit quality remained favorable for most Districts. However, contacts in the Richmond District noted that credit quality deteriorated slightly. Bankers in the St. Louis District reported that creditworthiness was largely unchanged for most loan applicants but declined somewhat for commercial and industrial lending. Contacts in the Atlanta District noted a drop in delinquencies and charge-offs. In the San Francisco District, financial institutions in states with a legal marijuana industry reported increased operational costs related to regulatory constraints. Agriculture and Natural Resources Agricultural producers faced mixed conditions during the reporting period, as contacts in many Districts reported that lower prices pushed down revenue despite growth in volumes. In the Chicago District, already low expectations for farm incomes deteriorated further, as the potential for a record national harvest pushed down crop prices further. Above-average water availability translated into record yields for almonds and walnuts in the San Francisco District. Contacts in several Districts reported strong yields for corn and soybeans. Severe flooding in parts of the Atlanta District lowered harvests somewhat, but cotton production is expected to expand relative to last year. Excess inventories of selected crops contributed to weak pricing trends. Growth in the price of agricultural products was flat to declining in many Districts, and contacts in Chicago reported that ample supplies of wheat, dairy, and some meat products resulted in price declines. In contrast, dairy producers in the Dallas District benefited from a price rally over the past six weeks. In Kansas City, bankers reported that, while agricultural loan delinquencies remained low, requests for loan extensions increased and loan repayment rates weakened. Overall, demand for energy-related products and services continued to decline, albeit with some signs of stabilization. Oil extraction activity fell further, and contacts in the Atlanta District noted that inventories remained near historical highs despite a recent drawdown. In contrast, contacts in the Kansas City District reported an uptick in the number of active oil and gas drilling rigs in response to an anticipated increase in oil prices. Demand for natural gas varied across Districts. In the Cleveland District, demand increased as the utility and power generation sectors continue to migrate from coal-fired plants to using natural gas. Contacts in Atlanta reported that the supply of natural gas remained elevated and demand declined further. Coal production declined further in St. Louis. More generally, coal prices fell further, while the prices of oil and natural gas were flat to slightly up. Contacts in the Minneapolis District reported a slight uptick in mining activity, and noted that an idled iron ore mine resumed production and broke ground on an expansion. Contacts in Dallas remained optimistic for modestly improving conditions in the energy sector through the end of the year and into 2017. Employment, Wages, and Prices Employment expanded at moderate pace since the previous report. Conditions in the labor market remained tight in the Boston, Chicago, New York, San Francisco, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Districts. In Boston, contacts reported an unusually high number of job openings, and in the Richmond District turnover rates increased for entry-level positions. Employment gains were only modest in Cleveland, and contacts in Philadelphia reported an increase in part-time employees and longer workweeks along with a reduction in full-time hires. In many Districts, businesses reported trouble filling job vacancies for high-skilled positions, especially those aimed at technology specialists, engineers, and selected construction workers. Overall, employment declined in the carbon extraction industry; however, contacts in the Atlanta District reported an uptick in hiring at petrochemical refining companies. Wage growth ranged from flat to strong across the Districts, but most reported that wage pressures remained fairly modest. Contacts in Minneapolis reported moderate wage pressures, while contacts in St. Louis and San Francisco reported strong wage growth. On balance, wage pressures increased for highly skilled workers in many Districts, and contacts in San Francisco reported continued strong wage growth for technology specialists. In Cleveland, wage pressures were most evident in the construction and retail sectors. In Philadelphia, wage pressures were modest, but contacts reported upward pressure to employee benefit expenses from rising health-care costs. In general, expectations of wage growth for the coming months were modest. Overall price inflation was modest. The Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, and Dallas reports suggested that prices were largely unchanged from the previous period. St. Louis reported modest price pressures. Businesses in the Atlanta and Kansas City Districts reported slight increases in input prices, while reports on selling prices were mixed. The prices of finished goods rose at a somewhat slower pace in Richmond, compared with the previous reporting period. Contacts in several Districts expect prices to increase modestly in the coming months, and manufacturers in Philadelphia are expecting smaller price increases than nonmanufacturers.",2016-09-07
117,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas based on information collected on or before October 7, 2016. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.   Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest national economic activity continued to expand during the reporting period from late August to early October. Most Districts indicated a modest or moderate pace of expansion; however, the New York District reported no change in overall activity. Compared with the previous report, the pace of growth improved in the St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Outlooks were mostly positive, with growth expected to continue at a slight to moderate pace in several Districts.  Labor market conditions remained tight, with modest employment and wage growth noted over the reporting period. Most Districts characterized input costs and/or output prices as fairly flat, but prices increased slightly on net. Manufacturing activity was mixed, and the strong dollar continued to dampen exports of manufactured goods according to a few District reports. Most regions saw an uptick in retail spending, and outlooks were for modest growth in the months ahead. Reports on auto sales and tourism varied across Districts. Demand for nonfinancial services generally increased, and staffing firms noted steady or higher demand. Port traffic and e-commerce-related activity rose in Districts that commented on it, but reports on other transportation services mostly indicated weakness. Residential construction and real estate activity expanded further, although low home inventories continued to constrain sales in a few Districts. Home price appreciation continued at a modest pace in general, and commercial real estate activity and construction improved since the last report. Demand for business and consumer loans increased, aside from some seasonal slowing, and credit quality remained strong or improved. Agricultural conditions were mixed, as low commodity prices pressured farm revenues despite generally strong crop yields. There were signs of stabilization in the oil and natural gas sector, while reports of coal production were mixed. Employment, Wages, and Prices Employment expanded at a modest pace over the reporting period. Reports of hiring were strongest in the Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts. Layoffs in the manufacturing sector were noted in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Richmond Districts. The Dallas District reported that energy-sector layoffs had abated, and manufacturing employment was stable following payroll reductions in recent months. Labor market conditions remained tight across most Districts. While reports of labor shortages varied across skill levels and industries, there were multiple mentions of difficulty hiring in manufacturing, hospitality, health care, truck transportation, and sales. The Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts noted a lack of construction workers, with some contacts noting these shortages were constraining construction activity. Wage growth held fairly steady at modest levels, although some Districts reported rising pressure for certain sectors. The Philadelphia District cited more upward wage pressure for some skilled jobs, while the St. Louis and San Francisco Districts said pressure intensified for some entry-level positions. These increases were often driven by a shortage of available workers. The competitive labor market also caused retail and tourism contacts in the Boston District to raise wages and prompted employers in the New York District to be increasingly willing to negotiate compensation, according to an employment agency. Also, some small business owners in the San Francisco District reported the need to reinstate previously dropped health care benefits to attract applicants. Overall price growth was mild. Most Districts reported flat input costs, although a slight increase was noted by firms in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts, and among manufacturing firms in the Richmond and Minneapolis Districts. Most Districts noted little change in selling prices over the reporting period, although there were scattered reports of price movements in certain sectors. Manufacturers in the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts reported declines in finished goods prices. Retailers in the Richmond and Kansas City Districts said selling prices edged up, while select retail chains in the Cleveland District were incrementally reducing shelf prices. Grocery contacts in the Chicago and Minneapolis Districts reported deflationary pressure on food prices, especially meat and dairy. Restaurants in the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts raised menu prices, and the San Francisco District cited modest increases in prices in the broader hospitality sector. Manufacturing  Reports on the manufacturing sector were quite varied across Districts. The Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts noted increased factory activity, while activity declined in the Richmond and Atlanta Districts and was steady to weaker in the New York District. The remaining Districts cited flat or mixed activity. Capital expenditures were also mixed. Spending cutbacks accelerated in the Cleveland District, and future spending plans lowered in the Philadelphia District but rose to the highest level in more than a year in the Kansas City District. Outlooks were generally positive, although the strong dollar continued to depress exports of manufactured goods in some Districts. Looking across the manufacturing sector, transportation manufacturing was a bright spot with strong growth reported in the Chicago and Dallas Districts, and the Cleveland District reported elevated activity for motor vehicle and aerospace suppliers. Growth in fabricated metals manufacturing was also a common trend, seen in the Philadelphia, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. For steel, demand fell in the Cleveland District and production weakened in the San Francisco District, where contacts noted that the elevated dollar, strong global production, and weak economic growth held back exports. There were several reports of continued weakness in the oil and gas sector still hurting demand for energy-related machinery and/or metal products in the Boston, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas Districts. Consumer Spending and Tourism Overall consumer spending was mixed this reporting period. The near-term outlook in the Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and St. Louis Districts was for modest growth, while contacts in the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts anticipated mostly flat sales. A majority of reporting Districts noted that retail sales increased this reporting period, although unseasonably warm weather impacted sales of cold-weather apparel in the New York and Cleveland Districts, and the strength of the dollar reduced spending by international customers in the Boston, Atlanta, and Dallas Districts. Reports on automobile sales were mixed. Declining sales were noted by the Kansas City and Dallas Districts, while increased sales were noted by the Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts. Tourism activity was mixed across the nation according to reporting Districts. The New York and Kansas City Districts mentioned that tourism activity slowed this reporting period, while the Richmond District noted steady activity, and the Atlanta and Chicago Districts said activity increased. Nonfinancial Services Demand for nonfinancial services generally expanded since the previous report. However, the New York District cited flat to declining activity, and Philadelphia's report noted that the pace of expansion slowed slightly from the previous period. Activity in healthcare services expanded in reporting Districts, and demand for high-tech or information technology services increased, according to reports from the Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts. Sales at restaurants slowed further in the San Francisco District, and business was flat to down among leisure and hospitality firms, according to the Dallas report. Service providers in the Dallas District noted an optimistic outlook, and professional and high-tech services contacts in the Kansas City District reported favorable capital spending plans. Staffing services demand grew at about the same pace or improved slightly since the prior report. Demand for staffing services strengthened in the New York and Dallas Districts, particularly in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, and continued to expand at a modest pace in the Philadelphia and Cleveland Districts. A large employment agency in the New York District said hiring was brisk and broad-based, while a staffing firm in the Chicago District reported flat activity. Demand for transportation services and freight activity declined on net, partly reflecting weak exports, excess capacity, and lower shipments of energy-related products. Transportation service firms cited slight declines in overall activity in the Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas Districts, while activity in the St. Louis District was characterized as mixed. Rail traffic was weak in reporting Districts, and air cargo volumes fell according to the Atlanta District's report. By contrast, transportation firms in the Kansas City District saw moderate growth in sales, and contacts in the Cleveland, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts reported increases in online retail or e-commerce related activity. Port traffic rose in the Richmond and Atlanta Districts, and evacuations were underway as hurricane Matthew approached, according to Richmond's report. Construction and Real Estate Residential real estate activity expanded in most Districts since the prior report, and contacts in a few Districts expressed optimism about future growth. Homes sales fell markedly in the Kansas City District, while slight to moderate gains were reported by most of the other Districts. Demand for lower-priced homes was solid in Districts that commented on it, while sales of higher-priced homes slowed in the New York, Chicago, and Dallas Districts, and in Alaska according to San Francisco's report. Home inventories were generally reported to be low or declining and were restraining sales growth according to the Boston, Philadelphia, and Minneapolis Districts. Home prices continued to rise at a modest pace across much of the country, which contacts in some Districts attributed to tight inventories and labor constraints. Growth in residential construction was generally flat to up during the reporting period, with particular strength noted in the San Francisco District. However, construction activity dipped slightly in the Richmond District partly due to lot shortages. Reports on multifamily activity varied but were positive on net. Strength in the apartment market was noted by the Dallas District (excluding the Houston metro area), while activity was mixed in the New York District. Growth in multifamily construction was positive in the Boston and Atlanta Districts but was mixed in the Richmond District and slowed further according to New York's report. Commercial real estate leasing activity generally improved, and outlooks were mostly optimistic, although contacts in a few Districts expressed concern about economic uncertainty surrounding the upcoming presidential elections. Commercial rents were flat to up, and vacancy rates were generally low and/or declined in reporting Districts, except in the Houston metro area where office vacancies increased further. Sales of commercial properties were characterized as robust in the Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts but softened in the greater Boston area. Commercial construction increased on net, with contacts in the Cleveland and Atlanta Districts reporting increased or high backlogs. Shortages of skilled labor remained a constraint on construction activity in some Districts, such as Cleveland and San Francisco. Banking and Finance Overall loan demand increased, although there were some scattered reports of seasonal softening in some categories of lending. Reports on residential lending were mixed, ranging from some seasonal slowing to growing. Commercial and industrial lending increased overall, although the Cleveland District noted lending is at a slower pace than desired and the New York District reported steady demand. Competition for borrowers remained strong across a number of reporting Districts. Loan quality remained strong or improved in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, and the New York and San Francisco Districts said delinquency rates remained low or declined since the last report. Credit standards were mostly unchanged this reporting period. Deposits grew slightly across most reporting Districts, although the Kansas City District cited stable deposit levels. Agriculture and Natural Resources Agricultural producers faced mixed conditions during the reporting period, as several Districts reported strong production for crops yet noted that low commodity prices continued to put pressure on farm incomes. Thanks to favorable growing conditions, record crops were expected for corn and soybeans in several Districts. The San Francisco District noted that yields of pistachios, almonds, and walnuts were expected to reach record levels this year. Above-average rainfall over the last several weeks slowed fieldwork in the Chicago and Minneapolis Districts, and hampered the cotton crop in some parts of the Dallas District. Contacts said that persistently weak farm income continued to reduce borrower liquidity in the Kansas City District, and farmers in the Dallas District were concerned about their ability to get adequate financing for next year. Signs of stabilization in the oil and gas sector continued, while coal production was up in the Cleveland and Richmond Districts but down in the St. Louis District. The Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts reported an increase in drilling and/or exploration activity. However, demand for oilfield services remained depressed in most of the Dallas District, despite the rise in the rig count. Energy contacts in the Atlanta District said that the drawdown of crude oil inventories continued. Natural gas extraction in the Richmond District was unchanged over the reporting period. The consensus among energy contacts in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts was continued optimism, with the majority of contacts in the Dallas District saying they expect 2017 to be a better year than 2016.",2016-10-19
118,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland based on information collected on or before November 18, 2016.

A tightening in labor market conditions was reported by seven Districts, with modest employment growth on balance. Districts noted slight upward pressure on overall prices.       Manufacturing       Demand for manufactured products was mixed during the current reporting period. Boston, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis reported modest or moderate growth, while Richmond noted that factory activity declined. The remaining Districts said that production was mixed or grew slightly. Gains in activity among chemical firms were reported in Boston, Philadelphia, and Dallas. The auto industry was a source of strength in Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis. Machinery manufacturing rose in Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Kansas City, but it declined in Chicago and Dallas. Aerospace-related manufacturers saw improving activity in Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City, while their counterparts in San Francisco saw orders decline. Philadelphia and Dallas noted weakening in fabricated metal products manufacturing, while producers in St. Louis are expanding capacity. The electronics industry expanded in Kansas City and San Francisco, while firms in Philadelphia noted weaker activity. The strong dollar remains a key concern for exporters in the Boston, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. In contrast, Kansas City reported that export orders continued to expand. Modest to moderate increases in capital investment are expected in the Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts, with several companies announcing facility expansion plans in St. Louis and Minneapolis. The overall outlook by manufacturers in New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas, and Dallas is positive, with most expecting growth in new orders and production during the next several months.       Nonfinancial Services       Most Districts experienced growth in nonfinancial services since the previous reporting period. New York was an exception, with reports of flat to declining activity among service-sector firms. Nevertheless, New York service contacts remained positive about the near-term outlook. High-tech and information technology services expanded in Richmond, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Most healthcare contacts anticipated future growth; however, San Francisco expressed concerns about potential changes to the Affordable Care Act.             Reports on transportation services were mixed. Kansas City reported a moderate decline in activity, while Atlanta reported little change and Dallas reported mixed cargo volumes. On the other hand, Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco experienced varying degrees of expansion.

Atlanta reported growth in port cargo shipments and a decline in trucking activity. Richmond noted stronger port traffic in recent weeks, and a national trucking firm in that District reported downward rate pressures because of excess capacity. Dallas noted steady truck and seaport cargo volumes.       Consumer Spending and Tourism       The Boston, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts reported that retail sales expanded at a moderate pace on balance. Retailers in New York, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City reported that sales were mixed to slightly higher, while their counterparts in Philadelphia, Richmond, and Atlanta characterized sales as unchanged. Weakening sales were seen in Cleveland and Dallas. Apparel sales were doing well in Boston, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and San Francisco, while contacts in Cleveland and Dallas suggested that the unusually warm weather may have hurt apparel sales. Boston, Cleveland, and Chicago saw an increase in furniture purchases. Cleveland and San Francisco noted declining sales at brick-and-mortar stores, a situation which they attributed to a consumer shift toward online purchasing. Contacts in Cleveland and Atlanta noted that sellers have little control over product pricing. Retailers in Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City expect modest positive sales growth during the rest of the year and remain optimistic for the holiday season. Dallas suggested that retail demand may not increase in the near term, driven partially by low sales in border cities because of the strong value of the dollar.             Motor vehicle sales declined slightly in most reporting Districts during the period. Kansas City saw sales decline well below year-earlier levels. In contrast, new vehicle sales in Chicago were characterized as strong, a circumstance which dealers attributed in part to aggressive incentives. Philadelphia indicated that light vehicle sales were plateauing at high levels, while Cleveland reported modest growth in motor vehicle sales but noted that this was driven by the used vehicle market. The New York and St. Louis Districts also noticed a shift in demand toward used vehicles. Richmond and St. Louis contacts suggested that softening vehicle sales might be attributed to uncertainty surrounding the presidential election, while contacts in Dallas point to energy-related weaknesses as a factor in the sales decline. Respondents in St. Louis and Kansas City expected a modest pickup in vehicle sales during the next several months, while contacts in Dallas were less confident for future growth.             Tourism was mostly positive relative to year-earlier levels: Boston, Minneapolis, and San Francisco experienced strong growth, while Philadelphia and Kansas City reported modest growth in activity. Respondents in Boston noticed continued strong international travel, although some contacts expressed uncertainty about the trend's continuing in 2017 if the dollar remains strong. New York reported that attendance at Broadway theaters slumped in October; however, revenues have increased and are on par with those of a year earlier.       Real Estate and Construction       Residential real estate activity improved across Districts. Reports about existing- and new-home sales were mixed, but most Districts noted a slight to modest increase during the period. Residential construction was up in the Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Home prices grew in many Districts, including Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco.

Agriculture and Natural Resources       Although agricultural conditions varied widely, farmers across reporting Districts were generally satisfied with this year's harvests. However, low commodity prices continue to weigh on farm income. Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas reported strong yields of corn and soybeans. Cotton harvests were above year-ago levels in Atlanta, St. Louis, and Dallas. The Richmond District reported that the biggest impact on international trade was in the poultry industry, with the loss of four million to five million birds killed by Hurricane Matthew and related floods.

Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas saw a slight increase in oil and gas drilling. Contacts in Dallas re-affirmed that oil and gas activity will pick up gradually in 2017. However, these expectations have moderated in light of recent revisions to the global oil demand and supply outlooks.

Boston reported fairly strong activity, with most staffing firms' revenues increasing 10 percent to 25 percent year-over-year. Staffing firms in Cleveland attributed a modest decline in the number of job openings and placements to uncertainty stemming from the presidential election.             As in the past four Beige Books, wage growth was characterized generally as modest, on balance, by district contacts. The St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts all reported moderate wage growth. Wage growth was modest in six of the twelve Districts: Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas. In the Richmond District, wages increased slightly.

Motor vehicle sales declined slightly in most reporting Districts during the period. Kansas City saw sales decline well below year-earlier levels. In contrast, new vehicle sales in Chicago were characterized as strong, a circumstance which dealers attributed in part to aggressive incentives. Philadelphia indicated that light vehicle sales were plateauing at high levels, while Cleveland reported modest growth in motor vehicle sales but noted that this was driven by the used vehicle market. The New York and St. Louis Districts also noticed a shift in demand toward used vehicles. Richmond and St. Louis contacts suggested that softening vehicle sales might be attributed to uncertainty surrounding the presidential election, while contacts in Dallas point to energy-related weaknesses as a factor in the sales decline. Respondents in St. Louis and Kansas City expected a modest pickup in vehicle sales during the next several months, while contacts in Dallas were less confident for future growth.

However, low commodity prices continue to weigh on farm income. Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas reported strong yields of corn and soybeans. Cotton harvests were above year-ago levels in Atlanta, St. Louis, and Dallas. The Richmond District reported that the biggest impact on international trade was in the poultry industry, with the loss of four million to five million birds killed by Hurricane Matthew and related floods.

Staffing firms in Cleveland attributed a modest decline in the number of job openings and placements to uncertainty stemming from the presidential election.             As in the past four Beige Books, wage growth was characterized generally as modest, on balance, by district contacts. The St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts all reported moderate wage growth.

Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Kansas City cited a slight pace of growth. Richmond characterized economic activity as mixed, and New York said activity has remained flat since the last report. Outlooks were mainly positive, with six Districts expecting moderate growth.                 Demand for manufactured products was mixed during the current reporting period, with the strong dollar being cited as a headwind to more robust demand in a few Districts. Modest to moderate increases in capital investment are expected in several other Districts. Business service firms saw rising activity, especially for high-tech and information technology services. Reports from ground freight carriers were mixed, while port cargo increased. A majority of Districts reported higher retail sales, especially for apparel and furniture. New motor vehicle sales declined in most Districts, with a few Districts noting a shift in demand toward used vehicles. Tourism was mostly positive relative to year-ago levels. Residential real estate activity improved across most Districts. Single-family construction starts were higher in a majority of Districts, while multifamily construction reports were mixed. Activity in nonresidential real estate expanded in many Districts. Banking conditions were largely stable, with some improvement seen in loan demand. Farmers across reporting Districts were generally satisfied with this year's harvests. However, low commodity prices continue to weigh on farm income. Investment in oil and gas drilling increased slightly, while reports on coal production were mixed. A tightening in labor market conditions was reported by seven Districts, with modest employment growth on balance. Districts noted slight upward pressure on overall prices.       Manufacturing       Demand for manufactured products was mixed during the current reporting period. Boston, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis reported modest or moderate growth, while Richmond noted that factory activity declined. The remaining Districts said that production was mixed or grew slightly. Gains in activity among chemical firms were reported in Boston, Philadelphia, and Dallas. The auto industry was a source of strength in Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis. Machinery manufacturing rose in Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Kansas City, but it declined in Chicago and Dallas. Aerospace-related manufacturers saw improving activity in Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City, while their counterparts in San Francisco saw orders decline. Philadelphia and Dallas noted weakening in fabricated metal products manufacturing, while producers in St. Louis are expanding capacity. The electronics industry expanded in Kansas City and San Francisco, while firms in Philadelphia noted weaker activity. The strong dollar remains a key concern for exporters in the Boston, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. In contrast, Kansas City reported that export orders continued to expand. Modest to moderate increases in capital investment are expected in the Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts, with several companies announcing facility expansion plans in St. Louis and Minneapolis. The overall outlook by manufacturers in New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas, and Dallas is positive, with most expecting growth in new orders and production during the next several months.       Nonfinancial Services       Most Districts experienced growth in nonfinancial services since the previous reporting period. New York was an exception, with reports of flat to declining activity among service-sector firms. Nevertheless, New York service contacts remained positive about the near-term outlook. High-tech and information technology services expanded in Richmond, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Most healthcare contacts anticipated future growth; however, San Francisco expressed concerns about potential changes to the Affordable Care Act.             Reports on transportation services were mixed. Kansas City reported a moderate decline in activity, while Atlanta reported little change and Dallas reported mixed cargo volumes. On the other hand, Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco experienced varying degrees of expansion. Atlanta and San Francisco noted continued strength in e-commerce shipments, while Cleveland contacts noted that Internet retailers are transitioning to on-demand delivery service providers for shipping as opposed to traditional ground carriers. Atlanta reported growth in port cargo shipments and a decline in trucking activity. Richmond noted stronger port traffic in recent weeks, and a national trucking firm in that District reported downward rate pressures because of excess capacity. Dallas noted steady truck and seaport cargo volumes.       Consumer Spending and Tourism       The Boston, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts reported that retail sales expanded at a moderate pace on balance.

Boston, Cleveland, and Chicago saw an increase in furniture purchases. Cleveland and San Francisco noted declining sales at brick-and-mortar stores, a situation which they attributed to a consumer shift toward online purchasing. Contacts in Cleveland and Atlanta noted that sellers have little control over product pricing. Retailers in Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City expect modest positive sales growth during the rest of the year and remain optimistic for the holiday season. Dallas suggested that retail demand may not increase in the near term, driven partially by low sales in border cities because of the strong value of the dollar.             Motor vehicle sales declined slightly in most reporting Districts during the period. Kansas City saw sales decline well below year-earlier levels. In contrast, new vehicle sales in Chicago were characterized as strong, a circumstance which dealers attributed in part to aggressive incentives. Philadelphia indicated that light vehicle sales were plateauing at high levels, while Cleveland reported modest growth in motor vehicle sales but noted that this was driven by the used vehicle market. The New York and St. Louis Districts also noticed a shift in demand toward used vehicles. Richmond and St. Louis contacts suggested that softening vehicle sales might be attributed to uncertainty surrounding the presidential election, while contacts in Dallas point to energy-related weaknesses as a factor in the sales decline. Respondents in St. Louis and Kansas City expected a modest pickup in vehicle sales during the next several months, while contacts in Dallas were less confident for future growth.             Tourism was mostly positive relative to year-earlier levels: Boston, Minneapolis, and San Francisco experienced strong growth, while Philadelphia and Kansas City reported modest growth in activity. Respondents in Boston noticed continued strong international travel, although some contacts expressed uncertainty about the trend's continuing in 2017 if the dollar remains strong. New York reported that attendance at Broadway theaters slumped in October; however, revenues have increased and are on par with those of a year earlier.       Real Estate and Construction       Residential real estate activity improved across Districts. Reports about existing- and new-home sales were mixed, but most Districts noted a slight to modest increase during the period. Residential construction was up in the Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Home prices grew in many Districts, including Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Philadelphia reported that the strength of the single-family market is in high-end housing. In contrast, Kansas City reported that sales of low- and medium-priced homes continued to outpace sales of higher-priced homes. Dallas reported that the sales of lower-priced homes remained solid. Home inventories were generally reported to be low or declining and restraining sales growth. Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and Minneapolis reported low or decreasing inventories. Reports on inventory levels varied in Atlanta, while inventories held steady in Kansas City.             Commercial construction activity moved higher in the New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. In contrast, Minneapolis noted a slowing in commercial construction. The Boston, Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts reported increases in leasing activity, while Philadelphia noted a lull in nonresidential leasing growth compared with the prior period. Dallas reported leasing activity as mostly unchanged. Commercial sales activity continued to be robust in Minneapolis and grew modestly in Kansas City. Ongoing multifamily construction has been steady at a fairly high level in New York. Multifamily construction varied in the Atlanta District and slowed somewhat in Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco.

On the commercial side, New York, Philadelphia, and St. Louis experienced strong demand for commercial and industrial loans, while C&I lending was slower in Dallas. Commercial real estate lending was strong in the New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland Districts. In Atlanta, some small businesses had trouble obtaining credit, and St. Louis reported slightly lower credit worthiness for agricultural customers only. Residential mortgage activity was steady in New York and Kansas City; higher in Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas; and strong in Cleveland and St. Louis. Auto lending was unchanged in St. Louis, up in Philadelphia and Dallas, and strong in Cleveland and Chicago. Credit quality was unchanged across most Districts, though improvements were seen in New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago. Credit standards tightened in select loan categories in the Boston, New York, and Philadelphia Districts, but they loosened slightly in Richmond, where contacts reported facing competition that used more aggressive loan structures.       Agriculture and Natural Resources       Although agricultural conditions varied widely, farmers across reporting Districts were generally satisfied with this year's harvests. However, low commodity prices continue to weigh on farm income. Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas reported strong yields of corn and soybeans. Cotton harvests were above year-ago levels in Atlanta, St. Louis, and Dallas. The Richmond District reported that the biggest impact on international trade was in the poultry industry, with the loss of four million to five million birds killed by Hurricane Matthew and related floods. San Francisco noted that the strong dollar continued to hold back exports of agricultural products, particularly apples and pears. Contacts in St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas said that farm incomes are flat or lower compared to those of a year ago. There were scattered reports about issues surrounding loan repayment and crop financing for 2017.             The energy sector continued to improve slowly across many of the reporting Districts. Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas saw a slight increase in oil and gas drilling. Contacts in Dallas re-affirmed that oil and gas activity will pick up gradually in 2017. However, these expectations have moderated in light of recent revisions to the global oil demand and supply outlooks. An oversupply of crude oil and gasoline continued in the Atlanta District, a situation which perpetuated a high demand for inventory storage. Coal production increased slightly in the Cleveland and Richmond Districts, but declined in St. Louis. The Minneapolis District noted that shipments of iron ore on the Great Lakes in September were more than 5 percent below levels of a year earlier. Contacts in Minneapolis and Atlanta reported expansion of renewable energy projects, particularly solar and wind.       Employment, Wages, and Prices       Employment continued to expand during the period. The Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts all reported moderate increases, while Boston and Minneapolis saw employment rise at a modest pace.

Philadelphia indicated that light vehicle sales were plateauing at high levels, while Cleveland reported modest growth in motor vehicle sales but noted that this was driven by the used vehicle market. The New York and St. Louis Districts also noticed a shift in demand toward used vehicles. Richmond and St. Louis contacts suggested that softening vehicle sales might be attributed to uncertainty surrounding the presidential election, while contacts in Dallas point to energy-related weaknesses as a factor in the sales decline. Respondents in St. Louis and Kansas City expected a modest pickup in vehicle sales during the next several months, while contacts in Dallas were less confident for future growth.

However, low commodity prices continue to weigh on farm income. Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas reported strong yields of corn and soybeans. Cotton harvests were above year-ago levels in Atlanta, St. Louis, and Dallas. The Richmond District reported that the biggest impact on international trade was in the poultry industry, with the loss of four million to five million birds killed by Hurricane Matthew and related floods. San Francisco noted that the strong dollar continued to hold back exports of agricultural products, particularly apples and pears. Contacts in St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas said that farm incomes are flat or lower compared to those of a year ago.

Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas saw a slight increase in oil and gas drilling. Contacts in Dallas re-affirmed that oil and gas activity will pick up gradually in 2017. However, these expectations have moderated in light of recent revisions to the global oil demand and supply outlooks.

Staffing firms in Cleveland attributed a modest decline in the number of job openings and placements to uncertainty stemming from the presidential election.             As in the past four Beige Books, wage growth was characterized generally as modest, on balance, by district contacts. The St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts all reported moderate wage growth. Wage growth was modest in six of the twelve Districts: Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas. In the Richmond District, wages increased slightly.

Motor vehicle sales declined slightly in most reporting Districts during the period. Kansas City saw sales decline well below year-earlier levels. In contrast, new vehicle sales in Chicago were characterized as strong, a circumstance which dealers attributed in part to aggressive incentives.

Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that the economy continued to expand across most regions from early October through mid-November. Activity in the Boston, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts grew at a moderate pace, while Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas cited modest growth. Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Kansas City cited a slight pace of growth. Richmond characterized economic activity as mixed, and New York said activity has remained flat since the last report. Outlooks were mainly positive, with six Districts expecting moderate growth.                 Demand for manufactured products was mixed during the current reporting period, with the strong dollar being cited as a headwind to more robust demand in a few Districts. Modest to moderate increases in capital investment are expected in several other Districts. Business service firms saw rising activity, especially for high-tech and information technology services. Reports from ground freight carriers were mixed, while port cargo increased. A majority of Districts reported higher retail sales, especially for apparel and furniture. New motor vehicle sales declined in most Districts, with a few Districts noting a shift in demand toward used vehicles. Tourism was mostly positive relative to year-ago levels. Residential real estate activity improved across most Districts. Single-family construction starts were higher in a majority of Districts, while multifamily construction reports were mixed. Activity in nonresidential real estate expanded in many Districts. Banking conditions were largely stable, with some improvement seen in loan demand. Farmers across reporting Districts were generally satisfied with this year's harvests. However, low commodity prices continue to weigh on farm income. Investment in oil and gas drilling increased slightly, while reports on coal production were mixed. A tightening in labor market conditions was reported by seven Districts, with modest employment growth on balance. Districts noted slight upward pressure on overall prices.       Manufacturing       Demand for manufactured products was mixed during the current reporting period. Boston, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis reported modest or moderate growth, while Richmond noted that factory activity declined. The remaining Districts said that production was mixed or grew slightly. Gains in activity among chemical firms were reported in Boston, Philadelphia, and Dallas. The auto industry was a source of strength in Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis. Machinery manufacturing rose in Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Kansas City, but it declined in Chicago and Dallas. Aerospace-related manufacturers saw improving activity in Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City, while their counterparts in San Francisco saw orders decline. Philadelphia and Dallas noted weakening in fabricated metal products manufacturing, while producers in St. Louis are expanding capacity. The electronics industry expanded in Kansas City and San Francisco, while firms in Philadelphia noted weaker activity. The strong dollar remains a key concern for exporters in the Boston, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. In contrast, Kansas City reported that export orders continued to expand. Modest to moderate increases in capital investment are expected in the Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts, with several companies announcing facility expansion plans in St. Louis and Minneapolis. The overall outlook by manufacturers in New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas, and Dallas is positive, with most expecting growth in new orders and production during the next several months.       Nonfinancial Services       Most Districts experienced growth in nonfinancial services since the previous reporting period. New York was an exception, with reports of flat to declining activity among service-sector firms. Nevertheless, New York service contacts remained positive about the near-term outlook. High-tech and information technology services expanded in Richmond, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Most healthcare contacts anticipated future growth; however, San Francisco expressed concerns about potential changes to the Affordable Care Act.             Reports on transportation services were mixed. Kansas City reported a moderate decline in activity, while Atlanta reported little change and Dallas reported mixed cargo volumes. On the other hand, Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco experienced varying degrees of expansion. Atlanta and San Francisco noted continued strength in e-commerce shipments, while Cleveland contacts noted that Internet retailers are transitioning to on-demand delivery service providers for shipping as opposed to traditional ground carriers. Atlanta reported growth in port cargo shipments and a decline in trucking activity. Richmond noted stronger port traffic in recent weeks, and a national trucking firm in that District reported downward rate pressures because of excess capacity. Dallas noted steady truck and seaport cargo volumes.       Consumer Spending and Tourism       The Boston, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts reported that retail sales expanded at a moderate pace on balance. Retailers in New York, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City reported that sales were mixed to slightly higher, while their counterparts in Philadelphia, Richmond, and Atlanta characterized sales as unchanged. Weakening sales were seen in Cleveland and Dallas. Apparel sales were doing well in Boston, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and San Francisco, while contacts in Cleveland and Dallas suggested that the unusually warm weather may have hurt apparel sales. Boston, Cleveland, and Chicago saw an increase in furniture purchases. Cleveland and San Francisco noted declining sales at brick-and-mortar stores, a situation which they attributed to a consumer shift toward online purchasing. Contacts in Cleveland and Atlanta noted that sellers have little control over product pricing. Retailers in Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City expect modest positive sales growth during the rest of the year and remain optimistic for the holiday season. Dallas suggested that retail demand may not increase in the near term, driven partially by low sales in border cities because of the strong value of the dollar.             Motor vehicle sales declined slightly in most reporting Districts during the period. Kansas City saw sales decline well below year-earlier levels. In contrast, new vehicle sales in Chicago were characterized as strong, a circumstance which dealers attributed in part to aggressive incentives. Philadelphia indicated that light vehicle sales were plateauing at high levels, while Cleveland reported modest growth in motor vehicle sales but noted that this was driven by the used vehicle market. The New York and St. Louis Districts also noticed a shift in demand toward used vehicles. Richmond and St. Louis contacts suggested that softening vehicle sales might be attributed to uncertainty surrounding the presidential election, while contacts in Dallas point to energy-related weaknesses as a factor in the sales decline. Respondents in St. Louis and Kansas City expected a modest pickup in vehicle sales during the next several months, while contacts in Dallas were less confident for future growth.             Tourism was mostly positive relative to year-earlier levels: Boston, Minneapolis, and San Francisco experienced strong growth, while Philadelphia and Kansas City reported modest growth in activity. Respondents in Boston noticed continued strong international travel, although some contacts expressed uncertainty about the trend's continuing in 2017 if the dollar remains strong. New York reported that attendance at Broadway theaters slumped in October; however, revenues have increased and are on par with those of a year earlier.       Real Estate and Construction       Residential real estate activity improved across Districts. Reports about existing- and new-home sales were mixed, but most Districts noted a slight to modest increase during the period. Residential construction was up in the Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Home prices grew in many Districts, including Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Philadelphia reported that the strength of the single-family market is in high-end housing. In contrast, Kansas City reported that sales of low- and medium-priced homes continued to outpace sales of higher-priced homes. Dallas reported that the sales of lower-priced homes remained solid. Home inventories were generally reported to be low or declining and restraining sales growth. Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and Minneapolis reported low or decreasing inventories. Reports on inventory levels varied in Atlanta, while inventories held steady in Kansas City.             Commercial construction activity moved higher in the New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. In contrast, Minneapolis noted a slowing in commercial construction. The Boston, Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts reported increases in leasing activity, while Philadelphia noted a lull in nonresidential leasing growth compared with the prior period. Dallas reported leasing activity as mostly unchanged. Commercial sales activity continued to be robust in Minneapolis and grew modestly in Kansas City. Ongoing multifamily construction has been steady at a fairly high level in New York. Multifamily construction varied in the Atlanta District and slowed somewhat in Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco.       Banking and Finance       District reports indicated that the demand for credit varied widely. On the commercial side, New York, Philadelphia, and St. Louis experienced strong demand for commercial and industrial loans, while C&I lending was slower in Dallas. Commercial real estate lending was strong in the New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland Districts. In Atlanta, some small businesses had trouble obtaining credit, and St. Louis reported slightly lower credit worthiness for agricultural customers only. Residential mortgage activity was steady in New York and Kansas City; higher in Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas; and strong in Cleveland and St. Louis. Auto lending was unchanged in St. Louis, up in Philadelphia and Dallas, and strong in Cleveland and Chicago. Credit quality was unchanged across most Districts, though improvements were seen in New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago. Credit standards tightened in select loan categories in the Boston, New York, and Philadelphia Districts, but they loosened slightly in Richmond, where contacts reported facing competition that used more aggressive loan structures.       Agriculture and Natural Resources       Although agricultural conditions varied widely, farmers across reporting Districts were generally satisfied with this year's harvests. However, low commodity prices continue to weigh on farm income. Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas reported strong yields of corn and soybeans. Cotton harvests were above year-ago levels in Atlanta, St. Louis, and Dallas. The Richmond District reported that the biggest impact on international trade was in the poultry industry, with the loss of four million to five million birds killed by Hurricane Matthew and related floods. San Francisco noted that the strong dollar continued to hold back exports of agricultural products, particularly apples and pears. Contacts in St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas said that farm incomes are flat or lower compared to those of a year ago. There were scattered reports about issues surrounding loan repayment and crop financing for 2017.             The energy sector continued to improve slowly across many of the reporting Districts. Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas saw a slight increase in oil and gas drilling. Contacts in Dallas re-affirmed that oil and gas activity will pick up gradually in 2017. However, these expectations have moderated in light of recent revisions to the global oil demand and supply outlooks. An oversupply of crude oil and gasoline continued in the Atlanta District, a situation which perpetuated a high demand for inventory storage. Coal production increased slightly in the Cleveland and Richmond Districts, but declined in St. Louis. The Minneapolis District noted that shipments of iron ore on the Great Lakes in September were more than 5 percent below levels of a year earlier. Contacts in Minneapolis and Atlanta reported expansion of renewable energy projects, particularly solar and wind.       Employment, Wages, and Prices       Employment continued to expand during the period. The Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts all reported moderate increases, while Boston and Minneapolis saw employment rise at a modest pace. Overall, employment increased slightly in Philadelphia, was little changed in Cleveland, and held steady or increased in Dallas. Manufacturing employment reports were mixed, with four Districts reporting flat or declining payrolls and two Districts reporting increases in manufacturing employment. The Boston, Philadelphia, and Cleveland Districts noted increases in retail employment or hours, while the Richmond District noted decreases. Most Districts saw increases in staffing activity. Boston reported fairly strong activity, with most staffing firms' revenues increasing 10 percent to 25 percent year-over-year. Staffing firms in Cleveland attributed a modest decline in the number of job openings and placements to uncertainty stemming from the presidential election.             As in the past four Beige Books, wage growth was characterized generally as modest, on balance, by district contacts. The St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts all reported moderate wage growth. Wage growth was modest in six of the twelve Districts: Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas. In the Richmond District, wages increased slightly. Cleveland reported that wage pressures were more evident for select occupations, while Dallas noted that wage pressures were more widespread. Seven districts--Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas--noted that labor markets were tightening. Staffing services reported rising wages or difficulty filling positions without wage increases in a majority of the Districts.             Overall, there was slight price growth during the period. The Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Districts reported modest price increases, while most of the remaining Districts reported slight or limited price increases. The retail and services sectors reported slight to modest price increases, while agricultural product prices have stabilized at low levels. Contacts in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Districts reported increases in the cost of building materials, and contacts in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts noted downward pressure on freight transportation prices.",2018-03-07

Philadelphia and Dallas noted weakening in fabricated metal products manufacturing, while producers in St. Louis are expanding capacity. The electronics industry expanded in Kansas City and San Francisco, while firms in Philadelphia noted weaker activity. The strong dollar remains a key concern for exporters in the Boston, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. In contrast, Kansas City reported that export orders continued to expand.

Dallas suggested that retail demand may not increase in the near term, driven partially by low sales in border cities because of the strong value of the dollar.             Motor vehicle sales declined slightly in most reporting Districts during the period. Kansas City saw sales decline well below year-earlier levels. In contrast, new vehicle sales in Chicago were characterized as strong, a circumstance which dealers attributed in part to aggressive incentives. Philadelphia indicated that light vehicle sales were plateauing at high levels, while Cleveland reported modest growth in motor vehicle sales but noted that this was driven by the used vehicle market.

Staffing firms in Cleveland attributed a modest decline in the number of job openings and placements to uncertainty stemming from the presidential election.             As in the past four Beige Books, wage growth was characterized generally as modest, on balance, by district contacts. The St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts all reported moderate wage growth.

Contacts in St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas said that farm incomes are flat or lower compared to those of a year ago. There were scattered reports about issues surrounding loan repayment and crop financing for 2017.             The energy sector continued to improve slowly across many of the reporting Districts. Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas saw a slight increase in oil and gas drilling. Contacts in Dallas re-affirmed that oil and gas activity will pick up gradually in 2017. However, these expectations have moderated in light of recent revisions to the global oil demand and supply outlooks. An oversupply of crude oil and gasoline continued in the Atlanta District, a situation which perpetuated a high demand for inventory storage. Coal production increased slightly in the Cleveland and Richmond Districts, but declined in St. Louis. The Minneapolis District noted that shipments of iron ore on the Great Lakes in September were more than 5 percent below levels of a year earlier. Contacts in Minneapolis and Atlanta reported expansion of renewable energy projects, particularly solar and wind.

Staffing firms in Cleveland attributed a modest decline in the number of job openings and placements to uncertainty stemming from the presidential election.             As in the past four Beige Books, wage growth was characterized generally as modest, on balance, by district contacts. The St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts all reported moderate wage growth.

Activity in nonresidential real estate expanded in many Districts. Banking conditions were largely stable, with some improvement seen in loan demand. Farmers across reporting Districts were generally satisfied with this year's harvests. However, low commodity prices continue to weigh on farm income. Investment in oil and gas drilling increased slightly, while reports on coal production were mixed. A tightening in labor market conditions was reported by seven Districts, with modest employment growth on balance. Districts noted slight upward pressure on overall prices.       Manufacturing       Demand for manufactured products was mixed during the current reporting period. Boston, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis reported modest or moderate growth, while Richmond noted that factory activity declined. The remaining Districts said that production was mixed or grew slightly. Gains in activity among chemical firms were reported in Boston, Philadelphia, and Dallas. The auto industry was a source of strength in Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis. Machinery manufacturing rose in Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Kansas City, but it declined in Chicago and Dallas. Aerospace-related manufacturers saw improving activity in Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City, while their counterparts in San Francisco saw orders decline. Philadelphia and Dallas noted weakening in fabricated metal products manufacturing, while producers in St. Louis are expanding capacity. The electronics industry expanded in Kansas City and San Francisco, while firms in Philadelphia noted weaker activity. The strong dollar remains a key concern for exporters in the Boston, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. In contrast, Kansas City reported that export orders continued to expand. Modest to moderate increases in capital investment are expected in the Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts, with several companies announcing facility expansion plans in St. Louis and Minneapolis. The overall outlook by manufacturers in New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas, and Dallas is positive, with most expecting growth in new orders and production during the next several months.       Nonfinancial Services       Most Districts experienced growth in nonfinancial services since the previous reporting period. New York was an exception, with reports of flat to declining activity among service-sector firms. Nevertheless, New York service contacts remained positive about the near-term outlook. High-tech and information technology services expanded in Richmond, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Most healthcare contacts anticipated future growth; however, San Francisco expressed concerns about potential changes to the Affordable Care Act.             Reports on transportation services were mixed. Kansas City reported a moderate decline in activity, while Atlanta reported little change and Dallas reported mixed cargo volumes. On the other hand, Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco experienced varying degrees of expansion.

Atlanta reported growth in port cargo shipments and a decline in trucking activity. Richmond noted stronger port traffic in recent weeks, and a national trucking firm in that District reported downward rate pressures because of excess capacity. Dallas noted steady truck and seaport cargo volumes.       Consumer Spending and Tourism       The Boston, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts reported that retail sales expanded at a moderate pace on balance.

Boston, Cleveland, and Chicago saw an increase in furniture purchases. Cleveland and San Francisco noted declining sales at brick-and-mortar stores, a situation which they attributed to a consumer shift toward online purchasing. Contacts in Cleveland and Atlanta noted that sellers have little control over product pricing. Retailers in Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City expect modest positive sales growth during the rest of the year and remain optimistic for the holiday season. Dallas suggested that retail demand may not increase in the near term, driven partially by low sales in border cities because of the strong value of the dollar.             Motor vehicle sales declined slightly in most reporting Districts during the period. Kansas City saw sales decline well below year-earlier levels. In contrast, new vehicle sales in Chicago were characterized as strong, a circumstance which dealers attributed in part to aggressive incentives. Philadelphia indicated that light vehicle sales were plateauing at high levels, while Cleveland reported modest growth in motor vehicle sales but noted that this was driven by the used vehicle market. The New York and St. Louis Districts also noticed a shift in demand toward used vehicles. Richmond and St. Louis contacts suggested that softening vehicle sales might be attributed to uncertainty surrounding the presidential election, while contacts in Dallas point to energy-related weaknesses as a factor in the sales decline. Respondents in St. Louis and Kansas City expected a modest pickup in vehicle sales during the next several months, while contacts in Dallas were less confident for future growth.

Agriculture and Natural Resources       Although agricultural conditions varied widely, farmers across reporting Districts were generally satisfied with this year's harvests. However, low commodity prices continue to weigh on farm income. Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas reported strong yields of corn and soybeans. Cotton harvests were above year-ago levels in Atlanta, St. Louis, and Dallas. The Richmond District reported that the biggest impact on international trade was in the poultry industry, with the loss of four million to five million birds killed by Hurricane Matthew and related floods.

141,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland based on information collected on or before November 18, 2016. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.         Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that the economy continued to expand across most regions from early October through mid-November. Activity in the Boston, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts grew at a moderate pace, while Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas cited modest growth. Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Kansas City cited a slight pace of growth. Richmond characterized economic activity as mixed, and New York said activity has remained flat since the last report. Outlooks were mainly positive, with six Districts expecting moderate growth.                 Demand for manufactured products was mixed during the current reporting period, with the strong dollar being cited as a headwind to more robust demand in a few Districts. Modest to moderate increases in capital investment are expected in several other Districts. Business service firms saw rising activity, especially for high-tech and information technology services. Reports from ground freight carriers were mixed, while port cargo increased. A majority of Districts reported higher retail sales, especially for apparel and furniture. New motor vehicle sales declined in most Districts, with a few Districts noting a shift in demand toward used vehicles. Tourism was mostly positive relative to year-ago levels. Residential real estate activity improved across most Districts. Single-family construction starts were higher in a majority of Districts, while multifamily construction reports were mixed. Activity in nonresidential real estate expanded in many Districts. Banking conditions were largely stable, with some improvement seen in loan demand. Farmers across reporting Districts were generally satisfied with this year's harvests. However, low commodity prices continue to weigh on farm income. Investment in oil and gas drilling increased slightly, while reports on coal production were mixed. A tightening in labor market conditions was reported by seven Districts, with modest employment growth on balance. Districts noted slight upward pressure on overall prices.       Manufacturing       Demand for manufactured products was mixed during the current reporting period. Boston, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis reported modest or moderate growth, while Richmond noted that factory activity declined. The remaining Districts said that production was mixed or grew slightly. Gains in activity among chemical firms were reported in Boston, Philadelphia, and Dallas. The auto industry was a source of strength in Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis. Machinery manufacturing rose in Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Kansas City, but it declined in Chicago and Dallas. Aerospace-related manufacturers saw improving activity in Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City, while their counterparts in San Francisco saw orders decline. Philadelphia and Dallas noted weakening in fabricated metal products manufacturing, while producers in St. Louis are expanding capacity. The electronics industry expanded in Kansas City and San Francisco, while firms in Philadelphia noted weaker activity. The strong dollar remains a key concern for exporters in the Boston, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. In contrast, Kansas City reported that export orders continued to expand. Modest to moderate increases in capital investment are expected in the Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts, with several companies announcing facility expansion plans in St. Louis and Minneapolis. The overall outlook by manufacturers in New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas, and Dallas is positive, with most expecting growth in new orders and production during the next several months.       Nonfinancial Services       Most Districts experienced growth in nonfinancial services since the previous reporting period. New York was an exception, with reports of flat to declining activity among service-sector firms. Nevertheless, New York service contacts remained positive about the near-term outlook. High-tech and information technology services expanded in Richmond, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Most healthcare contacts anticipated future growth; however, San Francisco expressed concerns about potential changes to the Affordable Care Act.             Reports on transportation services were mixed. Kansas City reported a moderate decline in activity, while Atlanta reported little change and Dallas reported mixed cargo volumes. On the other hand, Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco experienced varying degrees of expansion. Atlanta and San Francisco noted continued strength in e-commerce shipments, while Cleveland contacts noted that Internet retailers are transitioning to on-demand delivery service providers for shipping as opposed to traditional ground carriers. Atlanta reported growth in port cargo shipments and a decline in trucking activity. Richmond noted stronger port traffic in recent weeks, and a national trucking firm in that District reported downward rate pressures because of excess capacity. Dallas noted steady truck and seaport cargo volumes.       Consumer Spending and Tourism       The Boston, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts reported that retail sales expanded at a moderate pace on balance.

Boston, Cleveland, and Chicago saw an increase in furniture purchases. Cleveland and San Francisco noted declining sales at brick-and-mortar stores, a situation which they attributed to a consumer shift toward online purchasing. Contacts in Cleveland and Atlanta noted that sellers have little control over product pricing. Retailers in Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City expect modest positive sales growth during the rest of the year and remain optimistic for the holiday season. Dallas suggested that retail demand may not increase in the near term, driven partially by low sales in border cities because of the strong value of the dollar.             Motor vehicle sales declined slightly in most reporting Districts during the period. Kansas City saw sales decline well below year-earlier levels. In contrast, new vehicle sales in Chicago were characterized as strong, a circumstance which dealers attributed in part to aggressive incentives. Philadelphia indicated that light vehicle sales were plateauing at high levels, while Cleveland reported modest growth in motor vehicle sales but noted that this was driven by the used vehicle market. The New York and St. Louis Districts also noticed a shift in demand toward used vehicles. Richmond and St. Louis contacts suggested that softening vehicle sales might be attributed to uncertainty surrounding the presidential election, while contacts in Dallas point to energy-related weaknesses as a factor in the sales decline. Respondents in St. Louis and Kansas City expected a modest pickup in vehicle sales during the next several months, while contacts in Dallas were less confident for future growth.             Tourism was mostly positive relative to year-earlier levels: Boston, Minneapolis, and San Francisco experienced strong growth, while Philadelphia and Kansas City reported modest growth in activity. Respondents in Boston noticed continued strong international travel, although some contacts expressed uncertainty about the trend's continuing in 2017 if the dollar remains strong. New York reported that attendance at Broadway theaters slumped in October; however, revenues have increased and are on par with those of a year earlier.       Real Estate and Construction       Residential real estate activity improved across Districts. Reports about existing- and new-home sales were mixed, but most Districts noted a slight to modest increase during the period. Residential construction was up in the Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Home prices grew in many Districts, including Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Philadelphia reported that the strength of the single-family market is in high-end housing. In contrast, Kansas City reported that sales of low- and medium-priced homes continued to outpace sales of higher-priced homes. Dallas reported that the sales of lower-priced homes remained solid. Home inventories were generally reported to be low or declining and restraining sales growth. Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and Minneapolis reported low or decreasing inventories. Reports on inventory levels varied in Atlanta, while inventories held steady in Kansas City.             Commercial construction activity moved higher in the New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. In contrast, Minneapolis noted a slowing in commercial construction. The Boston, Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts reported increases in leasing activity, while Philadelphia noted a lull in nonresidential leasing growth compared with the prior period. Dallas reported leasing activity as mostly unchanged. Commercial sales activity continued to be robust in Minneapolis and grew modestly in Kansas City. Ongoing multifamily construction has been steady at a fairly high level in New York. Multifamily construction varied in the Atlanta District and slowed somewhat in Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco.       Banking and Finance       District reports indicated that the demand for credit varied widely. On the commercial side, New York, Philadelphia, and St. Louis experienced strong demand for commercial and industrial loans, while C&I lending was slower in Dallas. Commercial real estate lending was strong in the New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland Districts. In Atlanta, some small businesses had trouble obtaining credit, and St. Louis reported slightly lower credit worthiness for agricultural customers only. Residential mortgage activity was steady in New York and Kansas City; higher in Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas; and strong in Cleveland and St. Louis. Auto lending was unchanged in St. Louis, up in Philadelphia and Dallas, and strong in Cleveland and Chicago. Credit quality was unchanged across most Districts, though improvements were seen in New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago. Credit standards tightened in select loan categories in the Boston, New York, and Philadelphia Districts, but they loosened slightly in Richmond, where contacts reported facing competition that used more aggressive loan structures.       Agriculture and Natural Resources       Although agricultural conditions varied widely, farmers across reporting Districts were generally satisfied with this year's harvests. However, low commodity prices continue to weigh on farm income. Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas reported strong yields of corn and soybeans. Cotton harvests were above year-ago levels in Atlanta, St. Louis, and Dallas. The Richmond District reported that the biggest impact on international trade was in the poultry industry, with the loss of four million to five million birds killed by Hurricane Matthew and related floods. San Francisco noted that the strong dollar continued to hold back exports of agricultural products, particularly apples and pears. Contacts in St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas said that farm incomes are flat or lower compared to those of a year ago. There were scattered reports about issues surrounding loan repayment and crop financing for 2017.             The energy sector continued to improve slowly across many of the reporting Districts. Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas saw a slight increase in oil and gas drilling. Contacts in Dallas re-affirmed that oil and gas activity will pick up gradually in 2017. However, these expectations have moderated in light of recent revisions to the global oil demand and supply outlooks. An oversupply of crude oil and gasoline continued in the Atlanta District, a situation which perpetuated a high demand for inventory storage. Coal production increased slightly in the Cleveland and Richmond Districts, but declined in St. Louis. The Minneapolis District noted that shipments of iron ore on the Great Lakes in September were more than 5 percent below levels of a year earlier. Contacts in Minneapolis and Atlanta reported expansion of renewable energy projects, particularly solar and wind.       Employment, Wages, and Prices       Employment continued to expand during the period. The Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts all reported moderate increases, while Boston and Minneapolis saw employment rise at a modest pace. Overall, employment increased slightly in Philadelphia, was little changed in Cleveland, and held steady or increased in Dallas. Manufacturing employment reports were mixed, with four Districts reporting flat or declining payrolls and two Districts reporting increases in manufacturing employment. The Boston, Philadelphia, and Cleveland Districts noted increases in retail employment or hours, while the Richmond District noted decreases. Most Districts saw increases in staffing activity. Boston reported fairly strong activity, with most staffing firms' revenues increasing 10 percent to 25 percent year-over-year. Staffing firms in Cleveland attributed a modest decline in the number of job openings and placements to uncertainty stemming from the presidential election.             As in the past four Beige Books, wage growth was characterized generally as modest, on balance, by district contacts. The St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts all reported moderate wage growth. Wage growth was modest in six of the twelve Districts: Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas. In the Richmond District, wages increased slightly. Cleveland reported that wage pressures were more evident for select occupations, while Dallas noted that wage pressures were more widespread.

Motor vehicle sales declined slightly in most reporting Districts during the period. Kansas City saw sales decline well below year-earlier levels. In contrast, new vehicle sales in Chicago were characterized as strong, a circumstance which dealers attributed in part to aggressive incentives.

In Atlanta, some small businesses had trouble obtaining credit, and St. Louis reported slightly lower credit worthiness for agricultural customers only. Residential mortgage activity was steady in New York and Kansas City; higher in Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas; and strong in Cleveland and St. Louis. Auto lending was unchanged in St. Louis, up in Philadelphia and Dallas, and strong in Cleveland and Chicago. Credit quality was unchanged across most Districts, though improvements were seen in New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago. Credit standards tightened in select loan categories in the Boston, New York, and Philadelphia Districts, but they loosened slightly in Richmond, where contacts reported facing competition that used more aggressive loan structures.       Agriculture and Natural Resources       Although agricultural conditions varied widely, farmers across reporting Districts were generally satisfied with this year's harvests. However, low commodity prices continue to weigh on farm income. Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas reported strong yields of corn and soybeans. Cotton harvests were above year-ago levels in Atlanta, St. Louis, and Dallas. The Richmond District reported that the biggest impact on international trade was in the poultry industry, with the loss of four million to five million birds killed by Hurricane Matthew and related floods. San Francisco noted that the strong dollar continued to hold back exports of agricultural products, particularly apples and pears. Contacts in St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas said that farm incomes are flat or lower compared to those of a year ago. There were scattered reports about issues surrounding loan repayment and crop financing for 2017.             The energy sector continued to improve slowly across many of the reporting Districts. Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas saw a slight increase in oil and gas drilling. Contacts in Dallas re-affirmed that oil and gas activity will pick up gradually in 2017. However, these expectations have moderated in light of recent revisions to the global oil demand and supply outlooks. An oversupply of crude oil and gasoline continued in the Atlanta District, a situation which perpetuated a high demand for inventory storage. Coal production increased slightly in the Cleveland and Richmond Districts, but declined in St. Louis. The Minneapolis District noted that shipments of iron ore on the Great Lakes in September were more than 5 percent below levels of a year earlier. Contacts in Minneapolis and Atlanta reported expansion of renewable energy projects, particularly solar and wind.       Employment, Wages, and Prices       Employment continued to expand during the period. The Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts all reported moderate increases, while Boston and Minneapolis saw employment rise at a modest pace.

Boston reported fairly strong activity, with most staffing firms' revenues increasing 10 percent to 25 percent year-over-year. Staffing firms in Cleveland attributed a modest decline in the number of job openings and placements to uncertainty stemming from the presidential election.             As in the past four Beige Books, wage growth was characterized generally as modest, on balance, by district contacts. The St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts all reported moderate wage growth. Wage growth was modest in six of the twelve Districts: Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas. In the Richmond District, wages increased slightly. Cleveland reported that wage pressures were more evident for select occupations, while Dallas noted that wage pressures were more widespread. Seven districts--Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas--noted that labor markets were tightening. Staffing services reported rising wages or difficulty filling positions without wage increases in a majority of the Districts.             Overall, there was slight price growth during the period. The Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Districts reported modest price increases, while most of the remaining Districts reported slight or limited price increases.

Investment in oil and gas drilling increased slightly, while reports on coal production were mixed. A tightening in labor market conditions was reported by seven Districts, with modest employment growth on balance. Districts noted slight upward pressure on overall prices.       Manufacturing       Demand for manufactured products was mixed during the current reporting period. Boston, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis reported modest or moderate growth, while Richmond noted that factory activity declined. The remaining Districts said that production was mixed or grew slightly. Gains in activity among chemical firms were reported in Boston, Philadelphia, and Dallas. The auto industry was a source of strength in Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis. Machinery manufacturing rose in Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Kansas City, but it declined in Chicago and Dallas. Aerospace-related manufacturers saw improving activity in Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City, while their counterparts in San Francisco saw orders decline. Philadelphia and Dallas noted weakening in fabricated metal products manufacturing, while producers in St. Louis are expanding capacity. The electronics industry expanded in Kansas City and San Francisco, while firms in Philadelphia noted weaker activity. The strong dollar remains a key concern for exporters in the Boston, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. In contrast, Kansas City reported that export orders continued to expand. Modest to moderate increases in capital investment are expected in the Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts, with several companies announcing facility expansion plans in St. Louis and Minneapolis. The overall outlook by manufacturers in New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas, and Dallas is positive, with most expecting growth in new orders and production during the next several months.       Nonfinancial Services       Most Districts experienced growth in nonfinancial services since the previous reporting period. New York was an exception, with reports of flat to declining activity among service-sector firms. Nevertheless, New York service contacts remained positive about the near-term outlook. High-tech and information technology services expanded in Richmond, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco.

Atlanta reported growth in port cargo shipments and a decline in trucking activity. Richmond noted stronger port traffic in recent weeks, and a national trucking firm in that District reported downward rate pressures because of excess capacity. Dallas noted steady truck and seaport cargo volumes.       Consumer Spending and Tourism       The Boston, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts reported that retail sales expanded at a moderate pace on balance.

Boston, Cleveland, and Chicago saw an increase in furniture purchases. Cleveland and San Francisco noted declining sales at brick-and-mortar stores, a situation which they attributed to a consumer shift toward online purchasing. Contacts in Cleveland and Atlanta noted that sellers have little control over product pricing. Retailers in Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City expect modest positive sales growth during the rest of the year and remain optimistic for the holiday season. Dallas suggested that retail demand may not increase in the near term, driven partially by low sales in border cities because of the strong value of the dollar.             Motor vehicle sales declined slightly in most reporting Districts during the period. Kansas City saw sales decline well below year-earlier levels. In contrast, new vehicle sales in Chicago were characterized as strong, a circumstance which dealers attributed in part to aggressive incentives. Philadelphia indicated that light vehicle sales were plateauing at high levels, while Cleveland reported modest growth in motor vehicle sales but noted that this was driven by the used vehicle market. The New York and St. Louis Districts also noticed a shift in demand toward used vehicles. Richmond and St. Louis contacts suggested that softening vehicle sales might be attributed to uncertainty surrounding the presidential election, while contacts in Dallas point to energy-related weaknesses as a factor in the sales decline. Respondents in St. Louis and Kansas City expected a modest pickup in vehicle sales during the next several months, while contacts in Dallas were less confident for future growth.

Demand for manufactured products was mixed during the current reporting period, with the strong dollar being cited as a headwind to more robust demand in a few Districts. Modest to moderate increases in capital investment are expected in several other Districts. Business service firms saw rising activity, especially for high-tech and information technology services. Reports from ground freight carriers were mixed, while port cargo increased. A majority of Districts reported higher retail sales, especially for apparel and furniture.

Residential real estate activity improved across most Districts. Single-family construction starts were higher in a majority of Districts, while multifamily construction reports were mixed. Activity in nonresidential real estate expanded in many Districts. Banking conditions were largely stable, with some improvement seen in loan demand. Farmers across reporting Districts were generally satisfied with this year's harvests. However, low commodity prices continue to weigh on farm income. Investment in oil and gas drilling increased slightly, while reports on coal production were mixed. A tightening in labor market conditions was reported by seven Districts, with modest employment growth on balance. Districts noted slight upward pressure on overall prices.       Manufacturing       Demand for manufactured products was mixed during the current reporting period. Boston, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis reported modest or moderate growth, while Richmond noted that factory activity declined. The remaining Districts said that production was mixed or grew slightly. Gains in activity among chemical firms were reported in Boston, Philadelphia, and Dallas. The auto industry was a source of strength in Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis. Machinery manufacturing rose in Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Kansas City, but it declined in Chicago and Dallas. Aerospace-related manufacturers saw improving activity in Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City, while their counterparts in San Francisco saw orders decline. Philadelphia and Dallas noted weakening in fabricated metal products manufacturing, while producers in St. Louis are expanding capacity. The electronics industry expanded in Kansas City and San Francisco, while firms in Philadelphia noted weaker activity. The strong dollar remains a key concern for exporters in the Boston, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. In contrast, Kansas City reported that export orders continued to expand. Modest to moderate increases in capital investment are expected in the Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts, with several companies announcing facility expansion plans in St. Louis and Minneapolis. The overall outlook by manufacturers in New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas, and Dallas is positive, with most expecting growth in new orders and production during the next several months.       Nonfinancial Services       Most Districts experienced growth in nonfinancial services since the previous reporting period. New York was an exception, with reports of flat to declining activity among service-sector firms. Nevertheless, New York service contacts remained positive about the near-term outlook. High-tech and information technology services expanded in Richmond, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Most healthcare contacts anticipated future growth; however, San Francisco expressed concerns about potential changes to the Affordable Care Act.             Reports on transportation services were mixed. Kansas City reported a moderate decline in activity, while Atlanta reported little change and Dallas reported mixed cargo volumes. On the other hand, Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco experienced varying degrees of expansion. Atlanta and San Francisco noted continued strength in e-commerce shipments, while Cleveland contacts noted that Internet retailers are transitioning to on-demand delivery service providers for shipping as opposed to traditional ground carriers. Atlanta reported growth in port cargo shipments and a decline in trucking activity. Richmond noted stronger port traffic in recent weeks, and a national trucking firm in that District reported downward rate pressures because of excess capacity. Dallas noted steady truck and seaport cargo volumes.       Consumer Spending and Tourism       The Boston, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts reported that retail sales expanded at a moderate pace on balance.

Boston, Cleveland, and Chicago saw an increase in furniture purchases. Cleveland and San Francisco noted declining sales at brick-and-mortar stores, a situation which they attributed to a consumer shift toward online purchasing. Contacts in Cleveland and Atlanta noted that sellers have little control over product pricing. Retailers in Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City expect modest positive sales growth during the rest of the year and remain optimistic for the holiday season. Dallas suggested that retail demand may not increase in the near term, driven partially by low sales in border cities because of the strong value of the dollar.             Motor vehicle sales declined slightly in most reporting Districts during the period. Kansas City saw sales decline well below year-earlier levels. In contrast, new vehicle sales in Chicago were characterized as strong, a circumstance which dealers attributed in part to aggressive incentives. Philadelphia indicated that light vehicle sales were plateauing at high levels, while Cleveland reported modest growth in motor vehicle sales but noted that this was driven by the used vehicle market. The New York and St. Louis Districts also noticed a shift in demand toward used vehicles. Richmond and St. Louis contacts suggested that softening vehicle sales might be attributed to uncertainty surrounding the presidential election, while contacts in Dallas point to energy-related weaknesses as a factor in the sales decline. Respondents in St. Louis and Kansas City expected a modest pickup in vehicle sales during the next several months, while contacts in Dallas were less confident for future growth.             Tourism was mostly positive relative to year-earlier levels: Boston, Minneapolis, and San Francisco experienced strong growth, while Philadelphia and Kansas City reported modest growth in activity. Respondents in Boston noticed continued strong international travel, although some contacts expressed uncertainty about the trend's continuing in 2017 if the dollar remains strong. New York reported that attendance at Broadway theaters slumped in October; however, revenues have increased and are on par with those of a year earlier.       Real Estate and Construction       Residential real estate activity improved across Districts. Reports about existing- and new-home sales were mixed, but most Districts noted a slight to modest increase during the period. Residential construction was up in the Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Home prices grew in many Districts, including Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco.

In contrast, Kansas City reported that sales of low- and medium-priced homes continued to outpace sales of higher-priced homes. Dallas reported that the sales of lower-priced homes remained solid. Home inventories were generally reported to be low or declining and restraining sales growth. Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and Minneapolis reported low or decreasing inventories. Reports on inventory levels varied in Atlanta, while inventories held steady in Kansas City.             Commercial construction activity moved higher in the New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts.

Auto lending was unchanged in St. Louis, up in Philadelphia and Dallas, and strong in Cleveland and Chicago. Credit quality was unchanged across most Districts, though improvements were seen in New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago. Credit standards tightened in select loan categories in the Boston, New York, and Philadelphia Districts, but they loosened slightly in Richmond, where contacts reported facing competition that used more aggressive loan structures.       Agriculture and Natural Resources       Although agricultural conditions varied widely, farmers across reporting Districts were generally satisfied with this year's harvests. However, low commodity prices continue to weigh on farm income. Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas reported strong yields of corn and soybeans. Cotton harvests were above year-ago levels in Atlanta, St. Louis, and Dallas. The Richmond District reported that the biggest impact on international trade was in the poultry industry, with the loss of four million to five million birds killed by Hurricane Matthew and related floods. San Francisco noted that the strong dollar continued to hold back exports of agricultural products, particularly apples and pears. Contacts in St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas said that farm incomes are flat or lower compared to those of a year ago. There were scattered reports about issues surrounding loan repayment and crop financing for 2017.             The energy sector continued to improve slowly across many of the reporting Districts. Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas saw a slight increase in oil and gas drilling. Contacts in Dallas re-affirmed that oil and gas activity will pick up gradually in 2017. However, these expectations have moderated in light of recent revisions to the global oil demand and supply outlooks. An oversupply of crude oil and gasoline continued in the Atlanta District, a situation which perpetuated a high demand for inventory storage. Coal production increased slightly in the Cleveland and Richmond Districts, but declined in St. Louis. The Minneapolis District noted that shipments of iron ore on the Great Lakes in September were more than 5 percent below levels of a year earlier. Contacts in Minneapolis and Atlanta reported expansion of renewable energy projects, particularly solar and wind.

159,"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District     Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland based on information collected on or before November 18, 2016. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.         Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that the economy continued to expand across most regions from early October through mid-November. Activity in the Boston, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts grew at a moderate pace, while Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas cited modest growth. Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Kansas City cited a slight pace of growth. Richmond characterized economic activity as mixed, and New York said activity has remained flat since the last report. Outlooks were mainly positive, with six Districts expecting moderate growth.                 Demand for manufactured products was mixed during the current reporting period, with the strong dollar being cited as a headwind to more robust demand in a few Districts. Modest to moderate increases in capital investment are expected in several other Districts. Business service firms saw rising activity, especially for high-tech and information technology services. Reports from ground freight carriers were mixed, while port cargo increased. A majority of Districts reported higher retail sales, especially for apparel and furniture. New motor vehicle sales declined in most Districts, with a few Districts noting a shift in demand toward used vehicles. Tourism was mostly positive relative to year-ago levels. Residential real estate activity improved across most Districts. Single-family construction starts were higher in a majority of Districts, while multifamily construction reports were mixed. Activity in nonresidential real estate expanded in many Districts. Banking conditions were largely stable, with some improvement seen in loan demand. Farmers across reporting Districts were generally satisfied with this year's harvests. However, low commodity prices continue to weigh on farm income. Investment in oil and gas drilling increased slightly, while reports on coal production were mixed. A tightening in labor market conditions was reported by seven Districts, with modest employment growth on balance. Districts noted slight upward pressure on overall prices.       Manufacturing       Demand for manufactured products was mixed during the current reporting period. Boston, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis reported modest or moderate growth, while Richmond noted that factory activity declined. The remaining Districts said that production was mixed or grew slightly. Gains in activity among chemical firms were reported in Boston, Philadelphia, and Dallas. The auto industry was a source of strength in Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis. Machinery manufacturing rose in Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Kansas City, but it declined in Chicago and Dallas. Aerospace-related manufacturers saw improving activity in Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City, while their counterparts in San Francisco saw orders decline. Philadelphia and Dallas noted weakening in fabricated metal products manufacturing, while producers in St. Louis are expanding capacity. The electronics industry expanded in Kansas City and San Francisco, while firms in Philadelphia noted weaker activity. The strong dollar remains a key concern for exporters in the Boston, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. In contrast, Kansas City reported that export orders continued to expand. Modest to moderate increases in capital investment are expected in the Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts, with several companies announcing facility expansion plans in St. Louis and Minneapolis. The overall outlook by manufacturers in New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas, and Dallas is positive, with most expecting growth in new orders and production during the next several months.       Nonfinancial Services       Most Districts experienced growth in nonfinancial services since the previous reporting period. New York was an exception, with reports of flat to declining activity among service-sector firms. Nevertheless, New York service contacts remained positive about the near-term outlook. High-tech and information technology services expanded in Richmond, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Most healthcare contacts anticipated future growth; however, San Francisco expressed concerns about potential changes to the Affordable Care Act.             Reports on transportation services were mixed. Kansas City reported a moderate decline in activity, while Atlanta reported little change and Dallas reported mixed cargo volumes. On the other hand, Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco experienced varying degrees of expansion. Atlanta and San Francisco noted continued strength in e-commerce shipments, while Cleveland contacts noted that Internet retailers are transitioning to on-demand delivery service providers for shipping as opposed to traditional ground carriers. Atlanta reported growth in port cargo shipments and a decline in trucking activity. Richmond noted stronger port traffic in recent weeks, and a national trucking firm in that District reported downward rate pressures because of excess capacity. Dallas noted steady truck and seaport cargo volumes.       Consumer Spending and Tourism       The Boston, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts reported that retail sales expanded at a moderate pace on balance. Retailers in New York, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City reported that sales were mixed to slightly higher, while their counterparts in Philadelphia, Richmond, and Atlanta characterized sales as unchanged. Weakening sales were seen in Cleveland and Dallas. Apparel sales were doing well in Boston, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and San Francisco, while contacts in Cleveland and Dallas suggested that the unusually warm weather may have hurt apparel sales. Boston, Cleveland, and Chicago saw an increase in furniture purchases. Cleveland and San Francisco noted declining sales at brick-and-mortar stores, a situation which they attributed to a consumer shift toward online purchasing. Contacts in Cleveland and Atlanta noted that sellers have little control over product pricing. Retailers in Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City expect modest positive sales growth during the rest of the year and remain optimistic for the holiday season. Dallas suggested that retail demand may not increase in the near term, driven partially by low sales in border cities because of the strong value of the dollar.             Motor vehicle sales declined slightly in most reporting Districts during the period. Kansas City saw sales decline well below year-earlier levels. In contrast, new vehicle sales in Chicago were characterized as strong, a circumstance which dealers attributed in part to aggressive incentives. Philadelphia indicated that light vehicle sales were plateauing at high levels, while Cleveland reported modest growth in motor vehicle sales but noted that this was driven by the used vehicle market. The New York and St. Louis Districts also noticed a shift in demand toward used vehicles. Richmond and St. Louis contacts suggested that softening vehicle sales might be attributed to uncertainty surrounding the presidential election, while contacts in Dallas point to energy-related weaknesses as a factor in the sales decline. Respondents in St. Louis and Kansas City expected a modest pickup in vehicle sales during the next several months, while contacts in Dallas were less confident for future growth.             Tourism was mostly positive relative to year-earlier levels: Boston, Minneapolis, and San Francisco experienced strong growth, while Philadelphia and Kansas City reported modest growth in activity. Respondents in Boston noticed continued strong international travel, although some contacts expressed uncertainty about the trend's continuing in 2017 if the dollar remains strong. New York reported that attendance at Broadway theaters slumped in October; however, revenues have increased and are on par with those of a year earlier.       Real Estate and Construction       Residential real estate activity improved across Districts. Reports about existing- and new-home sales were mixed, but most Districts noted a slight to modest increase during the period. Residential construction was up in the Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Home prices grew in many Districts, including Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Philadelphia reported that the strength of the single-family market is in high-end housing. In contrast, Kansas City reported that sales of low- and medium-priced homes continued to outpace sales of higher-priced homes. Dallas reported that the sales of lower-priced homes remained solid. Home inventories were generally reported to be low or declining and restraining sales growth. Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and Minneapolis reported low or decreasing inventories. Reports on inventory levels varied in Atlanta, while inventories held steady in Kansas City.             Commercial construction activity moved higher in the New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. In contrast, Minneapolis noted a slowing in commercial construction. The Boston, Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts reported increases in leasing activity, while Philadelphia noted a lull in nonresidential leasing growth compared with the prior period. Dallas reported leasing activity as mostly unchanged. Commercial sales activity continued to be robust in Minneapolis and grew modestly in Kansas City. Ongoing multifamily construction has been steady at a fairly high level in New York. Multifamily construction varied in the Atlanta District and slowed somewhat in Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco.       Banking and Finance       District reports indicated that the demand for credit varied widely. On the commercial side, New York, Philadelphia, and St. Louis experienced strong demand for commercial and industrial loans, while C&I lending was slower in Dallas. Commercial real estate lending was strong in the New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland Districts. In Atlanta, some small businesses had trouble obtaining credit, and St. Louis reported slightly lower credit worthiness for agricultural customers only. Residential mortgage activity was steady in New York and Kansas City; higher in Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas; and strong in Cleveland and St. Louis. Auto lending was unchanged in St. Louis, up in Philadelphia and Dallas, and strong in Cleveland and Chicago. Credit quality was unchanged across most Districts, though improvements were seen in New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago. Credit standards tightened in select loan categories in the Boston, New York, and Philadelphia Districts, but they loosened slightly in Richmond, where contacts reported facing competition that used more aggressive loan structures.       Agriculture and Natural Resources       Although agricultural conditions varied widely, farmers across reporting Districts were generally satisfied with this year's harvests. However, low commodity prices continue to weigh on farm income. Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas reported strong yields of corn and soybeans. Cotton harvests were above year-ago levels in Atlanta, St. Louis, and Dallas. The Richmond District reported that the biggest impact on international trade was in the poultry industry, with the loss of four million to five million birds killed by Hurricane Matthew and related floods. San Francisco noted that the strong dollar continued to hold back exports of agricultural products, particularly apples and pears. Contacts in St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas said that farm incomes are flat or lower compared to those of a year ago. There were scattered reports about issues surrounding loan repayment and crop financing for 2017.             The energy sector continued to improve slowly across many of the reporting Districts. Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas saw a slight increase in oil and gas drilling. Contacts in Dallas re-affirmed that oil and gas activity will pick up gradually in 2017. However, these expectations have moderated in light of recent revisions to the global oil demand and supply outlooks. An oversupply of crude oil and gasoline continued in the Atlanta District, a situation which perpetuated a high demand for inventory storage. Coal production increased slightly in the Cleveland and Richmond Districts, but declined in St. Louis. The Minneapolis District noted that shipments of iron ore on the Great Lakes in September were more than 5 percent below levels of a year earlier. Contacts in Minneapolis and Atlanta reported expansion of renewable energy projects, particularly solar and wind.       Employment, Wages, and Prices       Employment continued to expand during the period. The Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts all reported moderate increases, while Boston and Minneapolis saw employment rise at a modest pace. Overall, employment increased slightly in Philadelphia, was little changed in Cleveland, and held steady or increased in Dallas. Manufacturing employment reports were mixed, with four Districts reporting flat or declining payrolls and two Districts reporting increases in manufacturing employment. The Boston, Philadelphia, and Cleveland Districts noted increases in retail employment or hours, while the Richmond District noted decreases. Most Districts saw increases in staffing activity. Boston reported fairly strong activity, with most staffing firms' revenues increasing 10 percent to 25 percent year-over-year. Staffing firms in Cleveland attributed a modest decline in the number of job openings and placements to uncertainty stemming from the presidential election.             As in the past four Beige Books, wage growth was characterized generally as modest, on balance, by district contacts. The St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts all reported moderate wage growth. Wage growth was modest in six of the twelve Districts: Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas. In the Richmond District, wages increased slightly. Cleveland reported that wage pressures were more evident for select occupations, while Dallas noted that wage pressures were more widespread. Seven districts--Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas--noted that labor markets were tightening. Staffing services reported rising wages or difficulty filling positions without wage increases in a majority of the Districts.             Overall, there was slight price growth during the period. The Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Districts reported modest price increases, while most of the remaining Districts reported slight or limited price increases. The retail and services sectors reported slight to modest price increases, while agricultural product prices have stabilized at low levels. Contacts in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Districts reported increases in the cost of building materials, and contacts in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts noted downward pressure on freight transportation prices.",2022-01-12
